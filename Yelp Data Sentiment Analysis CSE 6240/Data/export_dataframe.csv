Fairmont Dubai,Hotel," Best brunch in Dubai in my opinion. Excellent food, unlimited Moet and really good service. Exchange stays superb. Dubai changes but my favourite restaurant never does. Lovely! Cavalli Club looks like an old woman's boudoir! Those who do make the cut will find a lavish interior, baroque in style, with glittering lights and a DJ booth We r the celebrity overnight Did you know? The building design is based on a modern interpretation of an Arabic wind tower or ""barajeel."" The four ""pyramids"" atop each of the structure's corners represents four wind towers. Fairmont Dubai will be lit in pink to support Breast Cancer Awareness Month during the entire month of October. Let's stand together to find a cure. www.bcacampaign.com Brunch is great. Lots of different varieties of food also a brilliant array of desserts and cheese! You'll leave very full!! Night life here is a blast...! Good hotel and lives up to the Fairmont reputation, however it's age is starting to show and with so many new hotels on Sheikh Zayed Rd it's not ""the"" hotel anymore. Best place to stay while in Dubai at the Fairmont Hotel - President Club The Fairmont Dubai is a place where luxury meets impeccable service. Some of the highlights include their 10 entertainment venues, their Exchange Floor, and The Spa, which offers the best treatments. This place has the most beautiful pool ive ever seen Try the steaks at Exchange grill recently voted best steak steakhouse in Dubai Go to Spectrum One for Friday Brunch. Awesome.

Oh yeah that's fairmont Dubai Ôëç I choose the most spectacular hotel in Dubai: Fairmont Hotel :) There is a luxury night club, Roberto Cavalli in the luxury hotel. Have a good time!

Nice & amazing place to stay.. love it En el hotel de al lado est√° el restaurante japon√©s OKKU, la mejor comida japonesa que he probado. Cavalli's closed for renovation üòï Luxurious and Fancy Visit us next door at the 7th floor of Conrad Dubai. IZEL is a one of a kind venue that brings together the absolute best of Latin American food, entertainment and cigars."
Le Royal M  ridien Beach Resort   Spa,Hotel," A very good hotel.  If you do decide to stay here opt for the Club room, well worth the extra money.  Two hours worth of drinks and Afternoon Tea. Stay in the Tower Rooms when you are here. Loads of free benefits including cakes brought to your room mid day - Mmmmm Pretty impressive! excellent service & if you stay in Club room extras are great incl free afternoon tea & drinks in evening. Worth every dirham! √ìtimo hotel. Comprei pela internet, com acesso ao Clube Lounge. Atendimento perfeito, com 12 op√ß√µes de restaurantes. Vale a pena ficar aqui. Work Work Work Nice hotel, the garden and beach is worth every dirham. However if you enjoy the very temporary minimalist architecture, this one is not for you. Good squash and tennis courts, along with other sports facilities (ping pong, volleyball, football, water sports). All for free! Tower rooms are the best, but half of the rooms have a site construction view - ask for 13 or 14th floor to avoid Wifi is available in the lobby, all the rooms and also near the biggest pool. Free wi fi , free fruits, cakes in number in tower.

Try the Pizzeria, great service... It's the best hotel in Dubai! Everything is perfect here! Team building Lots of luxurious hotels could be found in Dubai, and this is one of the best. This beach hotel offers an amazing view of the Araboan Gulf and is home to the famous Caracalla, a spa and health club. Piano Bar is fantastic. Vangelis and his lovely wife make nice music. Don't miss out... Great hotel but slow Internet speed. I left my computer on all night and it still didn't finish downloading game of thrones. Get ready to tip your butler. When checking in break any large bills you. When the butler takes you to your room he'll expect a tip after he shows you how the room ""works"".  20D is fine. Make sure that you get a Sea view Room, they have the best balcony in dubai. Book a suite and enjoy perks such as complimentary private car transfers, complimentary  bottle of wine and fruit basket, complimentary buffet breakfast and so much more.

Dubai Marine Beach Resort   SPA,attraction," Best early morning relax at the sandy beach... close to home and to office :) Warning - this is not a 5* hotel. 3/4* at the best!!

Beach gathering Nice place with ""beans"" seats near sea with shicha, might be we will come again Don't stay here! It is supposed to be 5*, but I've been in better 3* hotels. The personal is not friendly, the rooms are very old and dirty. The whole place is an outdated cheap hotel. Avoid! Party time! A mix of clubs and restaurants. If you are looking for arabic, cuban or salsa music then this is the right place plus the different cuisines ranging from seafood to lebanese and italian All pubs, resto's and clubs are in this place. Both outdoors and indoors. Amazing mood and chilled out atmosphere at most of those places here. this is for you MBH.."

They play a lot of commercial house, and R&B.... Try the Dudu..good shot. Great R&B music. Parking is an issue and can cause traffic jams. I guess stags are allowed! Overall, do check out one! Guys Friday night they play the worst music... I thought it's a ladies night.. Or t Went on Thurs night. It's fun but the music is too mainstream for me (commercial RNB and house). An ultra-chic restaurant and club in one, enter this elegant Parisian-styled venue. One of the most exclusive in the city and absolutely the place to see and be seen in Dubai... members only, so know someone.  The most exclusive club in Dubai, you won't be disappointed.

Ski Dubai,Ski Trail," get into the big plastic ball that was fun ! Watch out for people who dont know how to ski and women with their face covered great fun! like real snow, and just as cold :( been living in dubai for 3 years but never been to ski dubai!  okay, now is the time i guess! coz itss freakin' hot! ski dubai will cool me down! If you're gonna ride the slopes bring a iPod to crack a few tunes on the way down! Features an 85-metre high indoor mountain with 5 slopes of varying steepness and difficulty, including the world's first indoor black run! Wrong location, this is in mall of the emirates not jebel ali! Ok, is not like skying on the mountain but it's the best thing we can have in Dubai. Anyway, be careful while skying. You might probably know to stand, but others don't. Enjoy it :) Endless fun & soooo much more than just skiing..... A must-see in Dubai! It has the feel of a real ski slope, in the middle of the desert. Make sure you bundle up, because it's just as cold as real snow. Look out for the children & those who can't ski. Amazing! Ski Dubai is incredible! Forget Colorado, come to Dubai to ski! The slope is amazing! Probably after 10 minutes you'll get bored...Cortina is better !!! ÓÑÜ indoor Ski Area in MOE! its like a football field covered snow! even larger than football field! I wanna came out from Ski Dubai when I was there If you want to come here, get the snowpark ticket. jika kepanasan ngadem disini loh.. Skiing in the desert? Of course! Five different runs of varying difficulty and length make this the perfect destination for all levels.‚Ä® Don't ever try aerial tricks! Too hard surface !

Who says it doesn't snow in Dubai? ;) Don't miss the penguins and the ice slides. Go early or go late, but never in between! Recommended by GayHills. Com Recommended by GayHills.Com The best place for kids and adults in dubai. You're not going to get bored there never!! Snow in desert wow what nice place Mohammed (Morocco) is a great instructor. I did both private lesson and group, I think group lesson is a better choice. My opinion. SkiDubai is a cold place to go in a hot desert. There are penguins, fun snowplay and even ski and snowboard lessons.  We take the ski lift to get hot chocolate at the top of the slopes. Nice penguin experience. Photos are a total rip off. 100dhs for 1 pic. They know u have to get the picture for the kids. So dissapointed. Never again... The penguins make it worth the visit!

Worth doing once for the novelty.  More challenging for snowboarders who do tricks/jumps, but otherwise gets boring fast for experienced skiers. Byo gloves and a beanie! Not sure why they have penguins in here as I've never seen any on the slopes of Switzerland, USA, or Canada! Good day out tho.... Dont eat yellow snow If you miss winter and snow or you had enough beach and sun that it is time for Ski Dubai :) it's great change and if you go with group of ppl it's more fun.Kids will be thrilled!!! 37c hava ≈üartlarƒ±nda i√ßerisi -5 kaymanƒ±n keyfi paha bi√ßilemez :) There are twenty penguins there worth seeing !!! Who says you can't ski and go to the beach on the same day in #dubai ? If you wanna go to penguins, be ready for disappointment. They will show you only 2 penguins.

Such a time saver! This movie theater is great! Definitely pay the extra 10 AED for a pillow and blanket. Totally worth it as the theater can get chilly. By far, the best cinema in Dubai. Only downside is the few number of screens but for an extra 15 dhm U get the best, most comfy, huge rclining seats and great sound system. Worth every Durham. No better way to take things off your mind then a trip to the novies Parker!!!!! I recommend. My favorite theater in dubai! Nice clean and amazing seats! It's really a nice cinema.

One of the best places to live... Come on a Friday morning to the cricket ground to see a friendly match amongst the neighbors!! Been living here since the begining, infact I was the 1st in my building. I have to be honest and say it is certainly not as good as it used to be and run down. The tenants dont help!

CNN Building,Office," Parking tends to be a big issue, so if you are going here you are better off taking a cab If you'e coming to CNN building you'll hardly find any parking in front of it. Even paid ones are always full. Try the big free parking (rough area) next to the REUTERS building (on walking distance) Grab a bite on Ground floor or 2nd floor The Second floor of the CNN Building has this awesome arabic restaurant called Zyara. They have an awesome AED 40 buffet(including a soft drink). Try their Hummus...its very nice. I'd say best in DXB. The steak salad or the pumpkin salad at Circle!! Yummm!! Well if you are a soup fan like me, you should try the ""Lentil soup"" from Circle .. But with a dash of lemon juice .. This building has a restaurant on the lake front. Grab yourself a gorgeous black beauty smoothie from Circle - its low fat! Loy of people have lack of vitamin d as per doctors.        This place is nice go take a walk in the sun in morning 8-9 and gain D. You won't loose money ;) Poor people work even on holidays and late night"

Last order is at 1:15! Curries are to die for G√ºzel mekan‚ò∫ Amazing collection of cocktails and each one better than the previous. I wish i could taste all. Definitely don't ask for a classic drink like a martini. Lovely spot!!! Merengue salsa... Too much overrated in terms of taste, you pay for the ambiance Avoid this place. The order never arrived. 50 min later we asked 4 the manager. Arrogant, tipsy, not focusing in a hurry. We cancelled order and he didn't care. Zero Customer service. Zero management Can get very crowded on weekends. Horribly expensive cocktails. Good music and ambience. Don't think much about what you'll drink, just have Singapore Symphony! üíõ If you haven't tried the Tiki Puka Puka here you most definitely are missing out Amazing like everytime...nice music...good drinks...nice atmosphere..a must see place in Dubai!

PS: do not forget to have some Nagos :-) Buy tickets in Row 9 and center seats for best viewing in the multiplex (small screens) You can have a good view from the row 11 as well. The seats on the sides doesn't matter in small screen cinema. IMAX experience like never before. The kiosks weren't functional and the fact that  IMAX was not functioning was not mentioned at the time of purchase of the ticket..Customer service has to be checked.its terrible!! Buy your tickets from the e-kiosk / way easier, better and less crowded. They should start making coffee.. I really feel like having coffee now :s Do an online ticket purchase/ booking. Though there are enough tellers, the movie goers are in hordes Crappy movie theatre with no customer service. They constantly publish incorrect showtimes, and are unapologetic abt it. 4 times in 2 months problems getting a correct showtime. Go elsewhere. If you are going for an afternoon movie, watch out. They keep one counter staff at the popcorn just to irritate you before entering the show. Long queues on weekends..

Zeta         ,Hotel Bar," Genial @ zeta try the fountain roll. Tempura shrimp and wagyu beef maki roll. Its smooth. The onion rings are to die for! Passion fruit ice tea is also amazing! They now have a straight through licence, so alcohol is served between 4pm and 6pm Great view of the fountains. Make sure you go past the bar and down the couple of steps.  Fountain roll is the best! The club sandwich is yameeeee Great view but unfortunately they are doing construction on the fountain that it ruin the view on burj kalifa!"
Media One Hotel                         ,Hotel," The burgers are amazing! The lobby restaurant downstairs serves a mean sandwich Sun-thurs cheese and wine at 7pm 150dhs/person While internet access in a hotel is a must, I've found it to be pretty expensive in the Middle East. Luckily, it's free in the lobby. All tweeps working in TECOM get 20% discount in all food and beverages in all outlets! Internet free... Great... Elevators are tricky... Inconvenient A new hotel option and meeting place in media city The burger at Cafe M is magnifico.. i did and the place was awesome! No wifi in the room, only cabled access :( Music from the bar gets pretty loud on Thursday and Friday nights and ends only at midnight so stay out till then if you're not a party animal. Small but very tastefully decorated rooms with all the comforts of a modern, 4 star hotel. Very good gym facilities and friendly staff. Free Internet at the lobby, cool! Internet free on 8th floor too Nice pool in the middle of media city Media Mondays No vallet service here! Where the buzz is in...! If you own a car don't get near this hotel! The pool party is really annoying, you can not sleep before they turn the music off, at midnight! Not recommended Brilliant place for business meetings. Great hotel, did not disappoint. Music does get loud at weekends tho. We were on 18th floor and could still hear it. Luckily we were up early for our flight. Still, doesn't put me off staying again. Free wifi log in on mediaone Killer roof top pool - very standard downtown LA The cafeM in this hotel is a wonderful European cafe where you can lounge in. The snacks are fantastic here as well. Don't stay here if you want a good night sleep.. Loud music till past 3 am last night Brilliant hotel but parking a pain. Guess we're spoilt with valet parking in Dubai. A place with value for money. Very friendly valet service! If going for Iftar,I highly recommend the middle eastern drink JALLAB. Best salad would be Apple coleslaw. Very polite valet service... Ask the bill when you have finished ordering. the Caf√© makes a good Caesar salad. The nearest metro station is just a few minutes' walk away from the hotel. Great Cheese&Wine night on Tuesdays- 150AED and nice atmosphere! Menu. $$$$ La terraza estupenda! They've revamped the pool deck area- great for parties & functions! Martha and the Chef saved our Christmas lunch with last minute turkeys- amazing gravy and wonderful cranberry sauce! Very polite and friendly staff. Got an early check-in with an upgrade, for FREE. Another hotel worth checking out.. Club Mina at Le Meridien is walking distance. Nice place to spend the day at the beach. The Bento Box is a smart way to do a business lunch .. super liked today !! Great for work/business stays in Dubai if you want to be near by the tech company offices. CAF√â M - PARKING/COFFEE/CROISANT - 07:00 - 10:30 - AED 35 I loved the hotel ...

UPTOWN MotorCity,Other Great Outdoors," Everybody seems to be out of luck to find parking at local Spinneys. Please try underground parking - lots of space, lift takes you next to the mall entrance. No queues, no time wasting Parking is very inconvenient for a huge supermarket like spinneys. Otherwise this is the best community around dubai. Cant avoid the most annoying road bumps ever! What where they thinking?? Walk, if the weathet is nice and avoid those road bumps ServeU, level of services is really bad especially plumping services Parking is kaaak Great community to live in, just few minutes walk to Spinneys and many good restaurants. Very green and lots of swimming pools. Nice quiet community. If you're around Beaufort Pool House (behind Dickens Circus 2 - Gate 3) join the Aqua Zumba  party taking place every Tuesday morning at 10 am at for the best workout at Motor City! ;) The best community in dubai. Great place for families. Best community in Dubai! Quiet, green and accessible. Prices are goin up in a crazy way.... Two bedroom is 105000aed!!!

Belgian Beer Cafe,Bar," Great selection of beers try the kwak beer, four of this will guarantee you to face the floor ;) I'm with Iyad on this.  Kwak is a innocent tasting lethality. Great atmopshere and good selection of beers.  However the food is better at the Festival City Branch Best fries ever! Belgian fries with mayonnaise and a Leffe Blobd Best Belgian brewery! Give it up for Hoegaarden! Along with the French Fries u'r good to go! Leffe blanc and fries all the way Laffe bruin Try their Mussels and fries Hoegarden & mussels best combo leffe blonde! Beautiful place. third floor is outdoors! Fries are addictive, which is just as well as the rest of the food is poor. A bit girly but I do love the cherry beer along with the leffe blonde. A tip from a Belgian; try the Leffe Blond and Kwak with bitterballen, cheese croquettes and carbonnade There is no need to try any fruit based beer unless you want to drink mineral water with fruit taste Have the 1 pot of mussels with white wine. Leffe blonde is a must try Great night out the burger sucks, don't go for that. stick to the fries Took 45min on the steak to arrive Because of a full restaurant and definitely worth the wait!! Hats off to the chef on a job greatly done! Beer bar! & specialty in Thai Mussels! Have all sort of beer here! My recommendation is Leffe Brune! Don't listen to them! Mussles, beef stew, croquettes all great. Belgians not known for their burgers! Definetely duvel..leffe blonde second and kwak for the shape of it to have a good laugh.. Belgium Fries a must great mussel's pot (blue cheese) and the awesome chocolate mousse ever O_O Have the feeling there's a new chef or management. Improvement when it comes to the food & terrace. The food is good! Don't overdo it! If you're dining, make sure you try the Duck Confit! Tender and melts away at the touch. Awesome fries:) Music has definitely improved :) Hidden gem. Try the Hoegarden which is rare in Dubai. (3 of 4 petals via Fondu) The Duck for main course is divine! Nevermind that Belgian beers aren't my favourite, I love the outdoor area in this bar. Try their nature mussels. Amazing! Great selections of beer too! The Belgian Beer Cafes has got some of the nicest beer in town - you can go there for a whole week & still not be able to try each one. Food is good as well, go for the mussel pot or Belgian sausages. Meatballs, veal chops and Belgium fries...all delicious. Caffee latte is good! Leffe Brune must try wifi: 0987667890 Delicious fries and mussels...too bad they don't have chimay though :-( Great beer selection and a very nice place to catch a football match! Surprised by the good mussels they serve especially the Thai sauce and the mouthwatering Belgian fries! Happy hours from 3:30 - 7:00 everyday ! I'd like to fancy myself a beer enthusiast ;) and Beligian Beer Cafe meets my highest expectations!! They offer a wide selection of beer that exceeds over 100. By far my favorite place to get beer! Steamed Mussels is a musst! And a large helping of Warsteiner. Cheers!!!! Wifi password: 0987667890 Just enjoy some beer ;¬£! Leave a tip? Hahaha, so funny! Ok, maybe not soOo funny :P Compared to Belgian beer cafe in Abu Dhabi or Madinat Jumeirah you only get half a portion of mussel & the lamb chops are very small too. Service is also just average.Wouldn't come back to this outlet Try kriek beer . Cannot describe cheery flavor in a beer . Tasty French fries with cheddar  are a must-have at this place Beer is soooo good... Beers all the way! Great Place & Food ComedyNight 14th March! Amazing Belgian cheesy fries!

Amazing Service and gorgeous rooms! Relax poolside and check out the snacks and smoothies at the poolside health bar. 1847 is one of the best men spa's. The staff is friendly & attentive. Ask for extra lotion if you get a pedicure. They give a short foot massage. Jet Set 4th floor is good for ladies hair The beat view in Dubai Marina ... Here, I come!

A terrace overlooking the marina is perfect for enjoying the views of the famous Dubai Palm & for eating breakfast at the small outdoor table. Have a nice trip home. See you tomorrow. Wired & wireless Internet is complimentary at this hotel, but what is not obvious from the starwood website, the complimentary Internet is throttled after you reach 1 GB within the 24 hour period Excellent Internet connection speeds, see speedtest link. Perfectly understandable that they throttle the complimentary access after 1GB / day. You can pay to extend the high speed beyond that limit Once you have used up your complimentary 1GB / day data allocation (e.g. by running a speed test and making a short skype video call) the throttled speed is pretty much unusable. So 80 Dhs/day nolimit Great place to unwind! They hook up your PS3 for you! Such an amazing hotel! True luxury!  Must experience Level 5!

Take a table at TgiF for best views. But it's a 3 min show after every 20 mins.

The bouncer upstairs is always looking for fights.. Just for fun.. Beware.. Aircrew night has been changed to wednesdays... Bullfrog is the best here.

McGettigan s JLT,Pub," 35 AED a pint :-( The burger is heavenly!!!! 50Dhs for Magners! Nice beer garden, great large outdoor screen, but they don't do shisha :( Don't order crisps, it seems to very complicated for them a. to understand what they are and b. to get them once they grasp what you're asking for. My tip, bring your own Yuki is very Yucky. Beware of rude, ugly bar staff Great lighting with lots of wood decor like a mountain lodge and a huge outdoor space to boot! Located across from the Spinney's and down the stairs Red neck central :S never again! service sucks, nothing special about the place itself.. can't really recommend at all.. Bring ear plugs. The Irish music is truly awful. Food average yet expensive. Cannot recommend. From a true afficionado, try the burger. Makes Shake Shack look like Shame Shack. Bangers and mash is amazing!! that chinese waitress is very feisty! she scares us all - heeeeeeee yahhhhh Forget about the music, focus on the fish and chips... yum! Service isn't great, food is good but expensive. Be sure to take an Entertainer voucher! Food is good,but expensive,specially for bar food, music too loud. Worst bar staff in the whole city! Beware of yuki! Bottles of Magners are always expensive, whetever you go. Draft is standard price. My personal favourite for a Saturday (morning). Best place to watch Rugby World Cup and have a tipple. They don't serve nibbles !! Pathetic!! So order the Great mixed platter!! Nice place, good service. Music is not too loud, and cost of beer like in other plases in Dubai. Like it Ice cold Guiness and a great wuyagi chilli. Try it One of the coolest places in Dubai Wooow best irish pub iPaddy Pub Quiz every Tuesday! Win an iPad and lots of other cool prizes! Modern decor. Beautiful people. Great buzz. Kilkenny that tastes different (over chilled maybe) from anywhere else and that's not a compliment! Jlt's must see! What the hell, its like hell here with NO A.C. Great place Nice (ACed) beer garden for the Euro 2012... Would avoid the place if I could.nothing special...food is below average...smoky atmosphere...annoying people. Magners!! In Dubai. Fuck yes. Not bad on weeknights, but overcrowded at weekends. 20 minutes wait to get served at the bar and so smoky that even smokers find it unpleasant The interior looks nice. The place seems to attract mostly Brit crowd of all ages. Music has hardly any volume. Beer was cold enough. Haven't tried food, so no comment. Fish n chips... :) Cool place to hang out. Good place to watch football. My best place in town for weekdays, the burger there is AMAZING, however the staff is definitely the worst I've ever seen! SO DAMN RUDE, unhelpful, slobs and mean! Dirty. Short on buss staff. Took forever to get us a menu then asked us to order on the spot. Smells like shit This is what you get after waiting 40 mnts for food?!!!! Never coming back again. The Chilli Cheese fries are awesome, especially with a pint of the black stuff After 22:00 try two things: Chips With Parmesan, Garlic and Herbs Sauce, and Scampi With Chips Nice place Changed my mind, this place is a smelly, soulless, noisy dive with an unfriendly atmosphere and terrible service. It attracts the kind of idiots who think that identikit ""Irish"" pubs are brilliant! The best place to view English Premier League football, including all the 3PM Saturday kick-offs across various screens! Love this place but the live band can get a bit too loud The only bar in Dubai that has atmosphere of a real bar/pub.. Wish the food was less expensive... Everyone should try hot wings!

Nice place :) Good music) Best sheesha Nice Shisha, nice ambience. Music SUX! Very good pizza margarita and pepperoni! They don't have hot drinks in evening - no tea, no coffee, only alcohol and sparking water! Worst service ever...They aren't serving coffee nor tea & yes they won't even cancel your order. Such a waste Ôò° The lamb chops and beef moussaka are a must try! No hot drinks????? Ridiculous! Serving some hot water with a tea bag is not too much to ask for!

 At The Top  Observation Deck,Scenic Lookout," At The Top is a great visit to experience to be in the current tallest skyscraper in the world - Burj Khalifa :) Visited it this year on Mother's Day Make sure you bring some drinking water especially if you plan to take your kids also cause there's no drinking water available Need to take a picture from the topic of the tower! 9 Sep 2010-- took us up and down on a service elevator after an hour long wait. Terrible experience! beat view in dxb Breathtaking view of Dubai You really won't get to the ""top"" of it coz you're only allowed to reach the 124th floor. :p Book a couple of days in advance. It's only AED100 rather than AED400 enterance fee AED100. U should make a reservation! clean the Deck glass!!! my photos are full of dust.. Breathtaking!! Avoid it if you fear heights been here last March 31, 2011 Tickets im Internet mit mindestens 48h Vorlauf kaufen oder vor Ort. Meistens ausverkauft. Am besten gleich am ersten Tag holen, um am letzten Urlaubstag auf den Burj zu kommen. Preis 100 DHS (20‚Ç¨). I see it from my office window every day...still amazing to look at...!!! Are you attending Mounir concert? Check in at any of our outlets & that will be your pass to the guest list of the after party and hangout with Mohamed Mounir personally :) Huge queues to go back down.. Shell out at least 3 hours for a good look around the place. Visit at sunset, the view is awesome! Get tickets online before you go and save 300dirhams! Also, don't stress if you're running a few minutes late. Park the car at the fashio center parking directions at the Dubai mall. Go just before dusk to get day and night shots of Dubai Leave plenty of time to get there as it takes a while to get there through the Mall and then the queue for the lifts I love the view Just woach Take lots of pics!! Both sunset and night time view is good. The walk to the Top is well done. Very clean and well maintained. If you go at night... Dont miss the fountain show from the top Not worth it if you're paying 400AED, according to me. You really won't get to the ""top"" of it coz you're only allowed to reach the 124th floor. :p Need to take a picture from the topic of the tower! Must see :) At The Top is a great visit to experience to be in the current tallest skyscraper in the world - Burj Khalifa :) Visited it this year on Mother's Day There are openings in the glass to take photos through outside. 400AED, no booking required and you get to cut all the queues. Get tickets online they are far cheaper than if you buy them on-site Nice place to visit Just get your tickets through Internet or be prepared to pay 400Dhs Only DHS100. Book 2-3 days in advance. If you want to be different from others; u have to observe differently from others. Breathtaking view from the Observation Deck of Burj Khalifa: not to miss. (Bucket List) If you are here in the evening do see the fountain from the top. Don't buy tickets for telescope,in my opinion, it doesn't worth it Ticket am besten online buchen. Das ist nicht nur g√ºnstiger sondern geht auch schneller: http://www.burjkhalifa.ae/ Buy tickets online to avoid the queues Try putting some rollercoaster! It will be a hell of a ride :) Spot the ""dancing fountains"" from the top! Amazing views! Book your tickets online for a much cheaper price! Just amazing night photos !!! Check the weather before u go,avoid sand storms and windy weather.... Don't rush to the elevators. Take your time as you walk through the exhibitions since you wont see them again on your way out. Amazing view but be ready to wait 20-30 mins both ways for the lift! Book online. Visit between 5.30 and 6.30pm. Perfect view..Ôòú Bueno lo vi desde el avion Promo offer of At the top + underwater zoo is on... dont miss it. They try to upsell you the ""telescope"" option for 50 dirhams. Not worth it in my opinion... Try to make it in time to watch the sunset. This is a joke. Besides the fact that you will not be able to go ""to the top"", queues and security will take so much time that you gonna miss the time slot you have booked. There goes the sunset. It takes 40 min. to get down from the top. Price for photo's taken at the entrance flexible. Don't pay more than 100 AED))) It's amazing to have a look from the height. The buildings below look like playground. Most recommended and it's worth to go on Top! Enjoy the view, rather than snapping pictures to show others. Masyallah......... Try to get the immediate ticket to skip the long queue in the World. The tallest Not much to do at the top when you are there but admire the view.

Pint   ,Bar, All food here takes 20-25 mins but the Kilkenny comes fast and fresh! It's a smoking area so sit away from the chimneys Eid Mubarak :) Comfort seating! great service! Highly irresponsible but encouragingly named bar. Tea for one for the win. Probably the only place at DXB airport where you can have a drink and smoke Quieter than neighboring Irish Village bar and way more comfortable seats. Terribly cheesy music. But not as smoky as the Irish Village...
Republique,Nightclub," Come by Republique from 9PM-3AM on weekends for the best music, guaranteed. And stop by on weekdays for indie rock, jazz, soul & pop on weekdays at the upstairs bar. The best music in town, all week Not gonna bash about the place, lets say it was a very unpleasant experience. not to mention the slow service & the bad music. Thursday is 80s and 90s night. Incredible music and unlike anything played in Dubai. Give it a try if you care more about dancing and singing than posing :D Friday is the best of Beirut with DJ Kam- Dance, Rock, RnB and even some 80s to keep the party going until 3 AM. It gets busy early so come before 11 :D Great venue...amazing music and service....highly recommended! If you like indie rock and rock in general, swing by the upstairs lounge & bar at Republique. Amazing music. Everything from Cut Copy to Phoenix and from Depeche Mode to Oasis. Slickness maDJam nights rock here!! Awesome venue, crap music. This place is awesome, But unfortunately some people here sucks Don't miss Dion Mavath & friends every Tuesday night for the most fun ladies night in Dubai. The new Tuesday nights are the official Cosmopolitan Magazine ladies nights in Dubai. Literally hundreds of girls and it was busy super early too (Photo was taken at 10PM) If you're looking for commercial house music, this is not the club for you- Republique is about ALL good music. Could be rock, 80s, old school hiphop, 90s Dance & everything in between. Had a great time there :)) I must return some time soon :) Its French Night every Tuesday. Seriously amazing vibe If you drop a pin on center of the map of Dubai, it would land on the DJ booth at Republique. If you ONLY like house music and/or posing and/or playing with sparklers, go somewhere else because there's none of that at Republique and its refreshing! Awesome for a change of scene & music Best club in town !!! Don't miss to go there Nice music, good crowd can get trashy sometimes. BUT dont take your wallet with you and watch out for your phone, lot of robberies happened recently in this place& their surveillance cams doesnt work! Not bad.. Good place for clubbing. Not bad.. Just a bit tight.. Always too crowded. Very tiny club but very friendly stuff and very danceable music. Get there a bit earlier to listen to the band upstairs. Music genre changes every night Cool place, owners are good people!"

Just save your money and daily calories intake allowance. Or you could just recommend it to your mother-in-law... try CLASSIC MOLTEN CHOCOLATE CAKE ! Classic Chocolate Molten Cake iss great!
