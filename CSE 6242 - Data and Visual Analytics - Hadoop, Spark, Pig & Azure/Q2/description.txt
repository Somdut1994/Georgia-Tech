11: defining a class 'Edge' with attributes 'src', 'tgt' and 'weight'
19: data is read
20: dataframe df is formed based on the structure of 'Edge'
21: df1 is the filtered df with weights greater than 1.
22 & 23: two dataframes are formed with 'src' and 'tgt' being dropped in two cases
(24 & 25) & (26 & 27): source and target summaries are formed adding the weights of each source and target in two separate sets (dataframes) adn they are named differnetly to be identified as separate entities for future application
28: Joining is done with matching src and tgt
29: the corresponding sum(weight) of the separated source and target sets were operated based on the formula to get overall weight
30: final data is formed
31: written to a tab spaced file
