            "[\"Antico is always an awesome experience; especially the Hemphill location. \\n\\nAuthentic pizza lovers in ATL probably already know of this gem. From its woodfire ovens to its wonderfully designed, cafeteria-feel layout; this place makes you feel like you're in a totally different country. \\n\\nMy cousin and I frequent this place and today we chose to go with one of our favorites: the napoletana.\\n\\nAs always, it was juicy, flavorful and had that kick we always crave! Perfect for those who love a spicier pizza. Tip: take some of the peppers off if it's too much and just take a bite of the pizza and then a separate bite of the pepper to have a better balance. Sometimes the peppers bunched up can be a bit too salty.<p>\\n\", 'Solid Pizza spot in ATL. Flavor was great and the thin crust was delicious. \\nThe open kitchen was a cool scene to dine in. \\nOne thing that needs an upgrade would be the restroom. \\nI think they need some renovation at certain areas\\nOtherwise, solid.<p>\\n', \"This place is one of my favorite pizza places in town. They have a locations in Alpharetta and in West Midtown. I've been here several times, this time I came for lunch on Saturday. They opened at noon and we arrived soon after so it was not too busy at that time. You order at the counter and then they will call your name when the pizza is ready. Dont forget to check out the counter with toppings. They have spicy peppers, olive oil with spices, garlic, cheese etc. \\n\\nThe pizzas are pretty big, however they are also pretty pricey. We ordered the Margherita with sausage ($25) and the Sophia ($27) which is a mushroom pizza with white sauce, onions and truffle oil. My favorite is definitely the Margherita. I love the tomato sauce and the cheese they use. We got 2 pizzas for 3 people and it was plenty of food. \\n\\nWhile you eat the pizza you can also see how they make it. All the ingredients are fresh and they make the dough in front of you. Overall this is a great place for families or to go with friends, but beware it's more expensive than most pizza places. \\n\\nIf you want dessert or coffee you can go across the street to Cafe Antico, which is part of the group of restaurants. They have really good gelato there.<p>\\n\", \"Hands-down the best pizza I've had in Atlanta. Whenever somebody from out of town asks me where they can find a good slice of pizza this is always my one and only recommendation. Nestled in the neighborhoods of West Midtown behind Georgia Tech Antico brings to lifethe Italian flavors that you're looking for in a pizzeria. This is a restaurant that takes into consideration the full flavor of a pizza. \\n\\nThe restaurant itself is not overwhelmingly pretty or aesthetically pleasing however the food itself is outstanding. The space is pretty small and gets crowded very quickly so you may have to wait a while for your pizza because of the high demand but it is well worth the wait. Upon entering you will order at the front desk and choose between 8 to 10 flavors. Fan favorites include the margarita  and Sofia pizza. \\n\\nYou will then enter the eating space which also combines as the kitchen for the restaurant. To me what I love about the restaurant is you get to see the process of them making the pizza from needing to placing the marinara sauce and the toppings.  You can watch as your pizza is been created in front of your eyes. The secret to Antico is the thin crust and the fact that they use ovens similar to that of Italy in that the pizza takes really only 2 to 3 minutes before being crispy and ready to eat. Again all of this can be watched and is a great experience for you to see how pizza is done first hand. It can get a little loud in this area as it is an active kitchen but again it is part of the experience of Antico. \\n\\nDrinks have to be purchased and they have tapwater for free so just a heads up on that end. You can bring your own wine to drink which is a great feature.\\n\\nAgain this is the best pizza in all of Atlanta and I highly recommend anyone to go trying it out. The experience itself is just great and I love going to Antico.<p>\\n\", 'Stopped by Antico while I was in Atlanta at the suggestion of a friend. It was super busy when we got there but the restaurant moved at such a quick pace we were able to order and find a seat quickly. The pizza was so delicious. Not super heavy but still very filling. The Diavola was so good I could have eaten a whole pizza by myself. Will definitely be back to try more.<p>\\n', \"Ever since moving to the Atlanta area, nearly every person I've asked for a recommendation has mentioned Antico - and I understand why! I my favorite so far is the Lasagna, but I haven't had a bad pizza here. \\nYou order at a counter, and go find a place to sit - I love being able to see where the pizza is being made and seeing all the fresh ingredients being prepped creating a great atmosphere. The pizzas are served on a giant baking sheet, and there are no plates - it's time to just dig in (and use lots of paper towels!) \\nThis is my favorite pizza spot in Atlanta, I look forward to coming back here every time I leave!<p>\\n\", \"I don't actually live in Atlanta, but every time I have gone to Antico Pizza, it has blown me away. All of the ingredients are always fresh. Plus being able to view the pizzas being made. Plus the little topping bar with fresh garlic, chilis and olive oil. It's too good!\\nI went with four others shown in the photo. We had gotten the Margherita pizza, and the two I can't remember the name. The one with meat on it the closer one had salami and pepperoni. All of them were awesome.<p>\\n\", \"On my last days in Atlanta I dug through my list of where to eat. On a rainy night my group decided take out pizza. Antico Pizza was recommended by friends. \\n\\nI called to order and was told that it would take about 10 minutes, so they would not allow pre ordering ahead which was odd. However they wanted to ensure quality control. So I do get it. \\n\\nThe restaurant sits on a corner and has very limited parking in their own lot and or off street. I walked into a pizza joint with 20's hipsters. There is seating but limited. There was a short line waiting for take out. I walked to the counter and ordered a margarita and a Diavola. The staff assisting was kinda meh. Pricing was much more than anticipated at a $46 price tag. Checkout smooth. \\n\\nThe pies were cranked out close to promised at around 15 minutes. The boxes are good quality, non descriptive cardboard. The ride back took around 10 minutes and the pizzas were luke warm. \\n\\nMy favorite was the Margarita with flavorful fresh ingredients and crispy crust. No greasy residue. The Diavola was good, but more spicy than I cared for. Others in my party really liked. Also the pies warmed up great in the oven next day. So was it worth the price? I say if you can afford it yes, but if I lived in Atlanta it could not be a regular due to pricing. \\n\\nI would come back and recommend.<p>\\n\", \"I'm going 5 stars because of two things--the pizza is really good, and it is BYOB. And being able to bring a great bottle of wine to a pizza place is pretty sweet. The one drawback is you don't want to go here for intimate conversation or romantic evening--the place is loud and festive. Favorite pizzas were the Margherita and the Diavolo. I didn't care for the lasagna pizza or San Gennaro.<p>\\n\", 'This review is based on dozens of visits over the last 8 years.\\n\\nAntico Pizza, in West Midtown is a staple of the ATL food scene. Yes there are other pizza places with delicious pizza, but Antico is the original spot for some of the best pizza in the city. There is street parking, parking in the back and parking in a side lot by the gelateria dubbed \"Little Italy\". \\n\\nThe dining process has largely remained the same over the year, come on in (BYOB if desired), order a pizza and find some seats. Self seating can be overwhelming for some, but a solid backup is to head across the street to eat outside at the gelato shop (even better on nice days). Seating inside is basically IN the kitchen, which is super cool, but also can get super loud a peak times. TIP: before your pizza arrives, grab some parmesan, spicy peppers, garlic and olive oil by the pizza prep area.\\n\\nFOOD TIME. When each order is ready someone walks around shouting the order number, so keep a watch for yours. Usually the wait is really short as these pizzas cook super fast in the massive pizza ovens.\\nAntico pizza is a magical combination of crispy outer crust and chewy inner dough. The consistency of the dough is PERFECT! I like my crust almost burnt, which is how Antico cooks their pizza. Grab some forks and knives, it\\'s ok to use these as it can get quite messy otherwise.\\n\\nI started off ordered the Diavola (because I love spicy), but switched my allegiance to the San Gennaro, which has meatballs and sweet peppers. I always grab some peppers from the back (same peppers that come on the Diavola), so you can make any pizza spicy! I have tried pretty much every pizza on the menu and you really can\\'t go wrong here.\\n\\nCons: It can get a bit loud at peak times and it can get a bit crowed as well. It\\'s nice that you can BYOB, but often we feel a bit rushed to get out because there are so many people waiting to snag some seats. I recommend trying Antico on a weekday evening instead of weekend for a calmer experience or ask them to bring it to you across the street at \"Little Italy\".<p>\\n', 'We come here every trip to Atlanta and it never disappoints  stick with the classic Margherita<p>\\n', \"So my wife and I live in Charlotte, but visit Atlanta pretty often. This is a go-to every time we go. It is without question my favorite neo-style pizza I've had. The sauce has its on perfect tang, crisp is super good and crispy.<p>\\n\", \"You don't need to read another review to know this is the best pizza in Atlanta!   If you don't think so and aren't sayiNg Varransano's...  you probably debate Domino's and Papa Johns.  And I just can't.  I don't speak stupid!<p>\\n\", 'Soft Drink Refill Speed: N/A\\n\\nBeing probably the most well-known pizza place in Atlanta comes with some baggage. On one hand, you expect it to be really good, on the other, I think there\\'s a tendency to want to call it overrated if it\\'s not transcendent.\\n\\nBut with a consensus of 4/5 Antico I think is perfectly rated. It\\'s really good, solid, wood-fired pizza. It\\'s not gonna change your life, but it\\'s great. The dining room can be tricky, since it\\'s relatively small for the amount of traffic it gets, and it can be loud during the dinner rush. It is BYOB though, which is a nice bonus, and you get to sit right near the ovens and see the pizza being made.\\n\\nI think it\\'s the non-pizza details that elevate it to the elite status most people give it, but on the pie merits, I\\'d temper a bit and say it\\'s just \"really quite good\".<p>\\n', \"Antico Pizza Napoletana is probably the best Neapolitan style pizza I've ever had outside of Italy. Believe me when I say I've tried many, if you know me, you know I live and breathe pizza. This one was perfect... their Diavola was voted best pizza in Atlanta in 2018 by Eater . I decided to go classic and do a margherita. The consistency of the dough is perfect, inner chewy and outer crispy at the crusts with charred air bubbles, just how I like it. The ingredients are all extremely fresh, you will inevitably know after taking one bite. The atmosphere is incredible, you can watch your pizza being made from one of the communal tables as italian music blasts in your ears. They serve it to you in a huge tin tray and then it's go time. Visit the condiment station for some freshly grated parmesan cheese, chili oil and much more. The cherry on top is that it's BYOB! Yes, you can bring your own bottle of wine to enjoy with no corkage fee. UNHEARD OF. \\n\\nI tried for the first time 3 weeks ago. I was in Atlanta yesterday for one night... and guess where I went for dinner? Yupppppp. ;) \\n\\nWalk across the street to Antico cafe to have some gelato for dessert! Or have a cannoli at Antico pizza, or do what I did and get both!! \\nEverything at Antico cafe is imported straight from Italy. Check out the freezer for the sorbets served and packaged right in their fruit shells. Sooo delicious!<p>\\n\", \"The pizza here is so good, I can't stop eating even when I'm full. I've been here a few times now dining in and taking it to go, and every experience has been great. \\nIt is SO hot inside in the summer months I wish they would turn on some air... I was sweating profusely inside. They don't have plates, so prepare to eat off the tray you're sharing or a napkin. They have all the condiments out in one spot so you can help yourself to everything.\\nIt's BYOB and no corkage fee, so bring a bottle of wine and prepare to eat some amazing pizza.<p>\\n\", 'I have always been a fan of Anticos since it opened. I was the first to write their public article since being the Atlanta examiner and have returned more times then I can count since that day of their opening. I will say, going to the one in the Avalon you get shortchanged a bit because the quality is not the same as the Atlanta location. If you havent tried anticos pizza before, definitely first try the location in Atlanta since this is the original location. My favorite pizza here is the diavola and no matter how many times I go I have to either get it to go or as one of our choices.<p>\\n', \"Let me preface this with the fact that I'm from Chicago, where I've enjoyed fantastic pizza of ALL styles. \\n\\nThis place is overrated and not worth a visit. Soggy, flavorless pizza made my husband and I laugh. Not sure what all the hype is about. In general, pizza is a weakness in Atlanta but I've definitely had much better elsewhere in the city.<p>\\n\", 'Anyone who has had a margherita pizza knows it\\'s easy to screw up, it\\'s hard to do good, and it\\'s almost near impossible to get perfect. Let me say this...Antico does it perfect. What a difference one ingredient can make. Oh my. That one magical and secret ingredient is....wait....get ready for it....garlic. BOOM! \\n\\nHaving vacillated over which Neapolitan place to try next I choose here and I am thankful I did. The interior is \"rustic\" to say the least. I do really like the dining hall style seating as it has a very nostalgic feeling for me. And I think that built environment and it\\'s geographical location lends itself to one of the better pizza experiences I have had outside of Italy. \\n\\nWith that said I would encourage anyone who is on the fence about trying this place to give it a shot; you won\\'t be disappointed. The pizza is larger than your standard 10-inch but that\\'s a good excuse to bring a date here. The San Marzano sauce and mozzarella cheese are exquisite but like I said before that garlic really brings the pie together. The dough is really good, too. Salted ever so slightly and a little thicker than your normal Neapolitan pie but it works really well. Oh, and if that wasn\\'t good enough the EVOO and Parmesan cheese really set this thing in orbit.<p>\\n', \"This was the best pizza I've had in Atlanta. We got the diavoli carry out and it was phenomenal. So flavorful and the best crust I've ever had. I love the structure of the restaurant. It's communal and exciting!! I can't wait to try more pies from Antico.<p>\\n\", 'Deliciously delicious that will keep me dreaming with deliciousness for the days to come. Pretty delicious indeed.\\n\\nThis pie is excellent in more ways than one. Expensive? Sure. But it is a big pie with big flavor and an experience so unforgettable you will want to run there tomorrow.\\n\\nIn terms of pizza, it is as good as you will ever find. It is Neapolitan style, so it is going to taste different than New York style, but in a good way. The slices are big, and it reflected in the entire experience, which is clearly five stars all the way. \\n\\nI guarantee you, if I lived here, I would eat here every day and weigh over 500 pounds as a result.\\n\\nWhat a delicious way to end this review, right?<p>\\n', \"Oh my! The atmosphere in this place is insane. The loudest restaurant I have ever been to in my entire life. Couldn't hear a single word anyone said. Painfully loud. They also don't have plates. If you want to eat, you need to rip off a piece of brown paper towel on the table. It's not cheap either! And if you want water you have to help yourself to the industrial faucet. The crowd was All college students. Also, it wasn't cheap for a place with no places, utensils, servers and only counter service.\\n\\nBut the food was served so fast and it was delicious.<p>\\n\", \"Came here with a friend who was visiting from Charleston. He used to live in Europe, and after tasting the pizzas here he claimed this was the next best thing to eating pizza in Italy! \\nLove the BYOB aspect - we also brought a bottle of wine and had it opened at the restaurant. There are also good bottles of wine that you can purchase at the restaurant. The pizza also stays great leftover, so don't worry if you can't finish all the pizza at the restaurant.\\nHighly recommend trying at least one white pizza - we had the one with mushroom, tomato, and broccolini.<p>\\n\", \"Antico Pizza is a solid choice for those wanting an above average pizza selection that stays true to its Italian flavor. The place itself is quaint, and had an authentic feel in a open 'cafeteria style' space. (You order at the counter and then seat yourself)  My friend and I visited on a Monday evening for an early dinner around 4 and only had a couple people ordering in front of us, but I know this place can grow quite the line, so try to beat the dinner crowd. \\n\\nWe ordered the Diavola and Pomodorini based on other recommendations, and I was NOT disappointed! My favorite was definitely the Diavola. This is a flavorful choice, with the perfect amount of spice and saltiness. Whatever kind of peppers are on here, they are soo good (more flavorful than anything). \\n\\nConsidering how busy space eventually got, the pizzas came out in a very reasonable amount of time. There are cups for water on all the tables, but we got a little confused where to actually find the water tbh. There's a sink in the main dining room, but we weren't sure thats where we were supposed to get water from.<p>\\n\", \"I've been coming to Antico for years. It's always my go to when I have out of town guests. \\n\\nParking is free. There are a few spaces out back in a parking lot and otherwise you can usually find parking along the nearby streets. \\n\\nInside you order first then find a place to sit in the family style picnic tables. If it's crowded the staff will help you find some space to eat. The pizza is delivered to you and they usually call out your order number. \\n\\nThe pizza here  is amazing and it comes out fast. My favorite is the San gennaro which has a little sweet hint from the peppers. This trip I got a margherita which is my go to. Theirs is one of the best in Atlanta. The nice thing about Antico is that the pizza comes out so fast! By the time you find a seat it's practically ready. They have a few spices and olive oil up front if you want to add some to your pie.\\n\\nOh did I mention byob? I really like that I can bring my own beer or wine with me. They have corkscrews and cups inside for your use. Ask the person taking your order for the corkscrew.<p>\\n\", \"This is probably one of the best pizza spots in Atlanta. The pizza is authentic, Italian-style pizza and made in a firebrick oven. It's thin but flavorful, and is enough to share with multiple people. A friend and I ordered the Pomodorini and it was delicious. The right balance/amount of every ingredient. And the pizza wasn't too dry or too wet. We also had a salad that was very fresh and light. The staff is extremely pleasant and the vibe in that area is very relaxed. Definitely makes you feel like you're in Italy.<p>\\n\", \"Many people talk highly about this place.\\n\\nUnfortunately it's poor at best.\\n\\nThey burn the crust, and the restaurant is very dirty.  Have tried, and not again.\\n\\nPlus the pizza is very greasy.\\n\\nWe have had better frozen pizza from a grocery store.<p>\\n\", \"Top 5 pizzas I've ever had (including New York pizza and pizza from multiple parts of Italy!). I've been to Antico multiple times over the years, and the place provides both authentic pizza and an authentic experience. \\n\\nThe restaurant is tucked away in an area with a few other Italian spots including a gelato place right next door. There's a good number of parking spots so it's an easy place to drive to. When you walk in, there is usually a line and you order at the counter. They have a few white pizza and a few red pizza options, all about $20 and relatively large in size. There are no appetizers or other dishes on their menu, and you aren't allowed to alter their pizzas. \\n\\nIf you decide to eat in, you can either sit in the room where you order the pizza or go into the larger room with more communal type seating. One side of this room are the ovens and chefs, and you can see the pizzas being made. Regarding the seating, if you arrive during the week or a little earlier on a Friday or Saturday then you shouldn't have too much trouble finding a spot. The pizza comes out quick within just a few minutes. There is also a little station where you can take pepper flakes, parmesan, hot peppers, olive oil, etc. \\n\\nThe pizza itself is incredible! My favorites here are the Diavola and Capricciosa. The dough is cooked enough to be a little crispy on the edges, but still very soft and delicious. The toppings are all fresh, and I love their red sauce. The pizza is also large enough to split between 2 people, and if you don't finish you can just grab a box to go!\\n\\nAntico is a staple of Atlanta and I will keep coming back!\\n\\nPro tip: It's BYOB (but they also sell beer and wine!)<p>\\n\", \"I can't believe I haven't reviewed Anticos by now, I have been going for 7 years or so now. This is my favorite pizza in Atlanta by far. We typically do takeout orders at this location since they tend to be busy. We always get the Diavola, so if you like spicy food I highly recommend it. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because the pizza dough is sometimes soggy (not fully cooked through) this is a more recent occurrence for me, so I would be sure to mention wanting it well-done when ordering. Other than that, the flavor is phenomenal!<p>\\n\", \"The pizza did not disappoint! Great pizza place probably the best pizza I've had and I've ate my share. The topping were good the sausage was spicy and marinara was really good huge flavor and the crust was the best it's what really made the pizza. The price was kind of high but the quality is worth every penny<p>\\n\", \"His: Oh my days! Pizza was super good. The ingredients by themselves were very good and high quality so put them all together...you get a great pizza. For me, the key for this amazing taste was the dough and how it was cooked. They nailed the cooking time and it's over a fire oven. Service was great! \\n\\nHers: Hands down the best pizza I've had! We ordered the San Gennaro pizza and it was FANTASTIC! The quality of ingredients are very fresh, especially the cheese they use! The pizza wasn't oily at all and they had various additional toppings to put on top. The place has a cozy hole in the wall feeling. You can sit across the kitchen area and watch your pizza be made right in front of you! Can't say enough good things about this pizza, highly recommend people to come here!\\n\\nWould we come back?\\n\\nHis: For sure! \\nHers: Come twice if you can! It's that good!<p>\\n\", \"There are many times where I find it difficult to provide a star rating in such a holistic regard, and this is absolutely one of those times. So take my rating with a grain of salt if you must, but I'll try my best to be as thorough as I can in my review.\\n\\nIf you've heard about this place, chances are you've heard that it's one of the best pizza places in Atlanta. Don't get me wrong, the pizza is good. There are absolutely times where I crave it, but there are also times where I just crave the idea of cheese, sauce, and dough in general. So why the harsh rating? Quite simply, I'm not too fond of the idea of paying over $20 for a single pie of cheese, sauce, and dough. If Antico's had a better pizza to dollar ratio, that could easily raise my rating.\\n\\nNow let's talk about the atmosphere. I see I'm not the first to say that the seating here isn't great. Not only is it difficult to find seating at busy times (Friday nights and weekends), but the entire arrangement isn't particularly conducive for intimate environments. This poses two significant problems: 1) it'll be difficult to find seating if you come with a large group and 2) if you're not in a large group, you'll likely have to share a table with strangers due to the way the place is set up. \\n\\nOverall, the two most frequent opinions I tend to hear about this place (in order, starting from most frequent) is 1) Antico's is the best pizza place in Midtown and 2) Antico's is overrated.<p>\\n\", \"This place is as authentic as it gets. Amazing neopolitan style pizza that they make in front of your eyes, with fresh ingredients at the highest quality. Pizzas are big enough to feed 2 or 3. Come out piping hot with fresh garlic, olive oil, and parm on the side. I cannot stress enough: this stuff is REAL DEAL. \\n\\nThe place is open seating and BYOB, so if you go on a Friday or Saturday night be prepared to wait to scoot into a tight seat. \\n\\nAbsolutely worth a stop, can't wait to come back and try all their speciality pizzas.<p>\\n\", \"Yelp is right. This is the best pizza I've ever had in Atlanta. It tastes very genuine Italian. There's plenty of indoor seating in a back room by the kitchen if you can't find any up front by where you order!<p>\\n\", \"I've never been to Italy but if the pizza tastes anything like I've had here, I can't wait to visit. After an escape room session to celebrate my birthday, my friends and I headed here for good conversation and food. Many people have raved about this place so I had to try it. Parking can be tricky if you don't know where you're going. They have a few parking spaces in the first, behind the restaurant and across the street. And the entrance will fool you too. You'd think the restaurant is small but head to the back and that's where the magic happens. The full on kitchen. You can watch your pizza being made. I love that concept. And it's community seating which makes conversations open if you so choose. \\n\\nSince everyone were newbies, we asked the cashier for the most popular dishes. She said the san gennaro (salami), diavola (Sausage), and lasagna were the top three. We ordered two classic margherita pizzas and one Diavola. The pizzas aren't served by the slice, only the pie. And the register lets you split the costs with a friend. Antico also sells wine by the bottle for a whopping $27! We ended up ordering one since it was my bday but made a mental note to BYOB next time. They also serve San Pellegrino sodas too and the Prickly Pear is a must try! \\n\\nThere's barely any wait for the pies. As soon as we were seated, our pizza was ready. And it came out piping hot! Cooked to perfection too. I've been back again since then and it was the same experience although I'd discourage you from visiting close to closing. The workers are trying to encourage you to finish your pie and leave as the clock gets close to 10pm!<p>\\n\", \"Sadly Disappointed.. Really wanted to like this place .. wanted to try something different for sister and my mom it was my sisters b day and wanted To do something low key. This was the first place that came to Mind ... pizza was extremely soggy.. we ordered a large margarita.. needed to cooked like 10 mins more to be well.. dough was super doughy .. was weird... when an employee came over to drop\\nOff the pizza he placed the tray down he knocked over  my cup of Pellegrino on me .. no apology.. just picked up the cup and moved on.. glad it wasn't my red wine .. so yea customer service sucks.. calzone and sauce were good tho.<p>\\n\", 'Their pizza is amazing, super casual with sturdy communal style tables and bench seating. A great thing too it is BYOB, which is amazing!<p>\\n', 'Why is this place sooo fabulous? Because you can bring your own bottle of wine! You can buy wine there as well. The pizza is great too! The restaurant has communal tables and can get packed pretty quickly. You just order and the bring your food out to you. There is also a pepper station with few options to top your pizza with.<p>\\n', \"I would have given this place 5 stars had there been a good greeting and customer service. I mean even an attempt at a smile, I would have taken, but no. \\n\\nThe cash register girl Fatla just treated me like I'm a homeless person off the street that scrounged up money for pizza. What embarrassing customer service! NEVER coming to this location again! \\n\\nI wish people who didn't like their jobs would just strait up quit!<p>\\n\", \"I've been to Anitco a handful of times at another location, but it was the hub's first time. And I dare say he really liked it as well. After honeymooning in Italy, we took our first try at something close to the real Italian pizza. We must say that Antico is pretty darn close. Their version is slightly a little more oily, and the dough is slightly different. But, it's still delicious!\\n\\nFor $20, it was a tad pricey, but it's a shareable pizza. The size is a medium to large. I don't know my pizza sizes so it's prob inaccurate. But large enough it is.\\n\\nYou can choose either a red or white pizza. We got the bianca. It had four cheese types: mozzarella, ricotta, buffalo, and pecorino. There are definitely other choices with veggies and/or meat, but we're a fan of the white pizzas. If you add extra garlic and cheese from the condiment station, your experience will be waaayyy better.\\n\\nThe seating space may look small, but there is an additional room towards the back where you can watch them make the pizza. The employees will shout out the order so you can have a seat and wait for the yumminess to arrive. \\n\\nParking: They have their own private parking lot. There's street parking as well.<p>\\n\", 'Pizza alone gets 4 stars but the service was pretty bad.  Came here on a Thursday evening and luckily was able to find a table in the front.  They call out your name once and then headed to back area.  Had to chase pizza down even though we call after him.  Then he put pizza down at a random table in the back.  I understand that it a busy place in a college area but never experienced this before.  Had the margarita dop and it was really good.  Pepperoni was a little salty.  The pizza dough was amazing.  Also love that they have condiments that we can get ourselves like olive oil, Parmesan cheese, peppers, etc.  I think ordering pizza to take home is the best option at this place.<p>\\n', \"Been wanting to try this place since 2014!!  Moved away 5 years ago...but came back to ATL on Pride weekend 2019. \\n\\nThe place doesnt look like much...dont be fooled!  Very simple decor, menu, but amazing pizza wuth super fresh flavors! Strong itlalian style ingredients and atomosphere.  Pizza's avg $24 per pie, and its enough for 3 hungry people.\\n\\nSuper casual enviroment!\\n\\nI suggest eating inside in the back where the cooks/ovens are located.  Adds to the ambiance/italian feel.<p>\\n\", 'One of the best pizzas I have ever had! Had the margherita with articokes. \\n\\nYou order as you walk through the front door. Grab a seat in the back, actually the kitchen, and they will call your number. Community family style seating, so get chummy with your neighbors. \\n\\n3 big brick ovens to make the pizzas. Pic enclosed.\\n\\nA couple of downsides: stingy on the toppings, parking is tough, and pricey. But so good!<p>\\n', \"Excellent pizza all the way around! Hot, fresh and fast! I've tried both the red sauced pies and the sauceless pies, and they are equally delicious. I got the Sophia (white pizza with mushrooms and truffle oil), and topped it with a bit of tomato sauce. So good my mouth is watering just typing that! Sheesh!<p>\\n\", \"I heard so much about this place, from word of mouth by friends to an online review by Dave Portnoy of Barstool Sports. Everyone gave it high praise, and I finally know why. I visited Antico for the first time, and it did not disappoint. From the moment I walked in and saw the small menu, friendly workers, and a seating area where you can watch the chefs craft your pizza, I knew it was a special place.\\n\\nMy friends and I ordered 3 pizzas! All of them were fresh and delicious. The mozzarella was stringy yet firm. The sauce was tangy. The crust had a beautiful crunch to it that only a stone fire oven could produce. Be prepared to eat off the tray because they do not provide plates! And it's BYOB so don't be afraid to bring your own glass of wine and give a toast to the wonderful pizza you're eating!<p>\\n\", 'Wow wow wow this place is beyond amazing. Quite possibly some of the best pizza I\\'ve ever had. Amazing crust, good sauce and great service.\\n\\nI came here on a Thursday around 1pm with a few friends and we had the Diavola pizza (spicy) and it was just right for a \"light\" lunch for four. The flavors were amazing, and my friend who has had true Italian pizza says this is pretty close to it. It was around $20 for the pizza, and around $6 or $7 for a beer. They also have wine.\\n\\nThe seating is communal tables and is good for large groups. It\\'s a fun vibe inside because you can watch the cooks making the pizzas (you\\'re in a big open room).\\n\\nHighly recommend this place!<p>\\n', 'Pizza was great. The bathroom was beyond disgusting. Unacceptable. Same at their pasty place across the street.<p>\\n', \"Antico routinely is mentioned as among the (if not the) best places to get pizza in Atlanta. The small menu of pies may not boast the seemingly limitless topping combinations and varieties that other, more modern pizzerias do, but the pizzaiolos here have truly mastered the art of Neopolitan pizza crust. The large rounds are rimmed with the ideal amount of char. A bite of the crust initially crackles and then yields to a soft yet chewy, tangy crumb. The crust rarely gets soggy and holds the weight of the toppings and sauce quite well. I have tried three varieties of pizza here thus far and have enjoyed the piquant diavola and veggie forward verdura the most. Pies run $20-25 which may seem steep, but note that they can feed two people.\\n\\nParking has never been an issue for me as there are small lots across the street and directly behind the restaurant. Additionally, I have always gotten takeout from here but eating in involves counter service and ostensibly limited space, so prepare for that if you're coming with a group. Antico has consistently satisfied my appetite and lived up to the hype due to exemplary crusts. Do note that if you're a topping kind of person like my fiance, Antico may not be your absolute favorite as they do not allow for custom pies or topping subs. Nonetheless, a visit to this Atlanta institution is a must for any fan of pizza.<p>\\n\", \"One of the best pies in Atlanta, and you can't beat the atmosphere.  Pizza was a bit doughy for my liking, but that's just personal tastes.  All around great place<p>\\n\", \"Look. I've never been to Italy and know that pizza isn't even their main thing, but listen yall. This has to be the best pizza I have ever tasted. \\nThis is saying a lot because I am a tried and true fan of Connecticut pizza (pepes!), and I'm from Chicago and lived in NY for half my life.. but yall. This is just...so good.\\nI actually had Felinis the night before and although I had a good experience, my friends did not. \\nThe experience is simple enough - you order from the menus - one side is red sauce, the other side is white. We stuck with the basics and just got a margherita because...why not? I was worried that one pie was not enough for three hungry people, but I ate most of it haha.\\nThey have traditional Italian sodas, like flavored pelligrinos and teas. \\nAfter you order, you can sit in the front, or go in the back where there is family style seating on benches and a full view of the kitchen. By the time you sit down,your food is ready. \\nThey have fresh chopped garlic and pepper to add to your pie and add I did. \\nI don't know what else to say - the crust was nice and thin, not soggy from the amazing sauce. The cheese was soooo good. \\nI dunno. You just have to try it.<p>\\n\", \"Italian pizza at its finest! I love the brick-oven pies here! The cheese is just right, the meat is delicious, and the dough is so chewy and light as well. Antico is a must try for those visiting town and it's a staple for most ATLiens. You have to try the pizza here if you haven't. Make sure to get yourself some extra red peppers at the sauce bar for a kick. They have all type of meat selections (pepperoni, sausage, meatball). Yummmm is all I can say!!<p>\\n\", \"WOWZA! This is some of the best pizza I've ever had! I don't think you can go wrong with any kind that you order, but I strongly recommend the margarita pizza! The dough is incredible--wood fire stove and cooked to perfection. The space is super cool; you can watch the cooks at work and the whole process start to finish. Definitely stop by for lunch or dinner!<p>\\n\", \"My girlfriend and I ordered a Margherita D.O.P. with pepperoni and enjoyed it throughly.  Great tomato sauce, good dough, wonderful taste.  The establishment has one bathroom and it was out of order during our visit.  They directed us across the street to a cafe, that had a men's bathroom that had water all over the floor.  Don't expect table service and be prepared to chase after your pizza.\\n\\nPizza: 4 stars\\n\\nService: 1 star<p>\\n\", 'The pizza was amazing and especially when you add the condiments like spicy peppers, crushed garlic and extra Parmesan cheese. I\\'m a thin pizza kind of guy and this fits my style. Beside pizzas in Italy, this may steal the second place trophy from me. The buffalo cheese is something out of my norm but it didn\\'t taste as gamy as I thought it would. The cool thing is that it\\'s a BYOB place. So bring your own beers or wine folks. The only downside to this downtown original location is that it is HOT!!! No A/C. So prepare to melt. Better \"bring your own ice\" as well.<p>\\n', \"Service is great, and it's a beautiful plaza full of Italian restaurants and art. \\nThe pizza was good, but not my favorite. I got the Bianca pizza, which is 4 cheese. The crust is on the thinner side but it's soo good. It has a special yeasty taste that reminds me of Italy. It's soft, and moist and slightly crunch.<p>\\n\", 'The perfect piece of pie! Thin bottom with rising, perfectly charred crust &amp; fresh tomato sauce! This pizza will make you rethink all other pizzas! 6 out of 5 stars!<p>\\n', 'Food is excellent. \\nOld method of getting food to customers by yelling out numbers. The venue when packed is too loud to hear anything. \\n\\nClassic pizza is delicious, simple ingredients, done right. Flavors are on point. \\n\\nLasagna pizza, amazing flavors and deep rich taste. \\n\\nFinding seating can be a pain and it can be hard to hear that your order is ready. But the food itself, is 5/5 as of April 2019. \\n\\nKeep up the passion in the food!<p>\\n', \"Having recently come from New York, I've been really craving some good pizza. Decided to try Antico since it wasn't far from where I was shopping that day. \\n\\nParking is pretty limited, but you might be able to find spots across the street at the cafe. I must've arrived at the right time because the line got really long after I ordered. \\n\\nThe menu is posted above where you order and pay, and then you seat yourself cafeteria style. It doesn't look like there's many places to sit at first, but walk through the back and there's another room with more seating. It's also where they make the pizzas. When your order is ready, your name will be called and it'll be brought to you. \\n\\nI got the margarita pizza with pepperoni and it looked great. It didn't take long to come out either - bonus points for the short wait time. However, it was soggy - couldn't hold up a slice to eat it. It didn't taste undercooked or anything though. The crust was pretty good in a really carb-y way if that makes sense. More like bread you would get preceding your meal at a restaurant. The pizza was very oily, but pepperoni was delicious. Definitely enough for 3-4 people depending how hungry you are. Side note - there's one rather dirty restroom to the left of the registers. \\n\\nNot my first choice place as I prefer something a bit lighter, less oily and a bit more crunchy. That could all be personal preference though.<p>\\n\", 'Pizza is stellar~ the whole set up of ordering at the front and drifting to the back where you find a huge open pizza kitchen is awesome.  The fresh pies and condiments are unquestionably the best in ATL.  The only reason why I give this place 4 stars is because every time I order on the phone, the receptionist/front is quite rude. You also have to wait a good bit for your pizza when you order ahead~ the last time I called, it took over 30 minutes from call time to actually getting the pizza in your hands (in the middle of the day, not even lunch or dinner times). I arrived about 10 minutes after calling and I still ended up waiting over 20 minutes. Maybe they don\\'t actually process the order until you get there and pay, because I got a brand new \"number\" when I paid. I strongly recommend eating in and enjoying the cool and fun ambiance!!!!<p>\\n', \"The BEST pizza in Atlanta.\\n\\nAntico is true Napoli pizza. Everything is fresh and made in house including their pepperoni. The pizza is thin but the crust is fluffy and probably the best part. A couple of years ago I went to Naples (birth place of pizza) and that pizza was the best I had ever had.\\n\\nAntico is exactly like the pizza I had in Naples. It's THAT good. This is my new favorite place in Naples! Oops, I mean Atlanta<p>\\n\", \"Everyone tells me that Antico's is one of the best pizza places in the country. I told myself not to expect too much when I finally decided to try it. I didn't want to get disappointed! Well. I definitely was not disappointed. \\n\\nAntico's has several locations, but this particular location is within walking distance from Georgia Tech. They have a parking lot behind the building, along with street parking at the various homes around. Beware. They do fill up because they get super busy during peak times. When you enter, there's a big menu overhead and you order at the counter. Keep your ticket, as you will need your ticket number. Seating is communal and they have those wooden, cafeteria-like tables. Oh if you opt to get tap water as your drink, note that the water will be coming from a sink. So I'd probably recommend just paying a little extra for a drink. They have sodas, bottled water, beer...a good variety. \\n\\nSo pick a seat after you pay/order. They'll call out your order number, you raise your hand, and they bring it over to you. I've had the San Gennaro ($22) and the Diavola ($22). They serve one size for all their pizzas and they say that one pizza can typically feed up to 3 people. I have come with 4 people and ordered 1 pizza. Each person got 2 (big) slices and we were all full. It just depends on your party's appetite really. I absolutely love their pizza. I guess it would be more accurate to say I love their dough. I could honestly care less what goes on the pizza. The dough is just that good. As far as the pizza, they go pretty light on the cheese, and their toppings are huge. So if you like getting a topping with every bite, this might not be for you.\\n\\nOverall, I would highly recommend Antico's. The place is a little small, but just be smart about when you come. Service is always super friendly, and prices are definitely reasonable for how much you get. Whenever I have anyone visiting from out of town, I usually take them here. It's a great, casual hangout spot, and they do have TVs. The only downside is how small it is inside for how busy they get!<p>\\n\", \"I loooooveeeee pizza so when I heard about Antico and I was visiting ATL for the weekend I just had to go. I was pleasantly surprised. Neapolitan pizza is my favorite and this one was perfect, so saucy, thin, and just the right amount of cheese. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars was because it was a little bit too doughy at some parts and I would have loved some more char to it however I can't wait to come again. The atmosphere is amazing you feel like you've been transported to an authentic pizza place right in Italy!! They have communal tables and one pizza is perfect for two (maybe even 3) people to share. And if you split the cost, it's a fantastic deal. I also loved the topping bar, I can't eat Neapolitan without olive oil so I was happy that was an option. And it was AMAZING olive oil!! Keep killin it Antico<p>\\n\", \"Unlike Avengers: Endgame, the hype is real. This is the best pizza in Atlanta. You consistently get an authentically Neapolitan, fresh, hot, beautiful masterpiece of a pizza. I get the Margherita D.O.P. every time as I'm a pizza purist and when the cheese, sauce, and crust are this perfect, why mess up a good thing? If you're not sold by now, Antico is also BYOB!  Save money on drinks, grab you a Two-Buck Chuck before you come and enjoy the ideal meal in the littlest of Little Italy's.<p>\\n\", 'The margharita pizza was superb! Also loved the vibe of the restaurant, you can sit in the back and watch them make pizza, and can also go across the street to sit outside under the umbrellas. Lovely way to spend a meal.<p>\\n', \"Wood fired Neopolitan pizza from Antico delivers a perfect pillowy crust with just the right amount of sauce and cheese !\\n\\nFire it up +'s:\\n+ Margherita ($20) hit the spot for us. Just straight up tomato, bufala, and basil. I split it with my partner who ate his half. I managed three slices with one to spare.\\n+ Fast turnaround. We grabbed a communal table and watched the staff fire the pizzas. Within 10' we had our pie in front of us.\\n+ Self-serve. I love that I can just box my own pizza by grabbing the boxes in the corners.\\n+ No frills. You order, sit, wait, and eat. It's not a hangout for me but I can see how the college crowd may like to linger but there's no beer served so why.\\n+ Pick red (rosso) or white (bianche) sauce. Plenty of choices available to suit.\\n\\nNo fire -'s:\\n- Limited help. That night we asked the staff what was soppressatta since it was one of the ingredients listed on the menu. It's Italian salami. I have a smart phone to tell me but it'd be ideal if the staff were knowledgeable about the place where they worked and could answer our question.\\n- Seating. Gets crowded and rowdy. Not really my speed.<p>\\n\", \"Delicious pizza! I always come here for pizza lunch when I'm in the area! I usually get the cheese pizza. Certainly a favorite place for me!<p>\\n\", 'Awesome pizza with a BYOB policy - this place makes for a good date night! Our pizza had perfectly flaky crust, plenty of cheese, and flavorful ingredients. We brought our own wine and they were nice enough to provide a corkscrew.\\n\\nThe only downside is the lack of seating during peak times, which is totally unsurprising as this place is popular and lives up to the hype!<p>\\n', \"Antico's Pizza is so delicious!!!!!! I ordered the Margherita pizza and everything about it was perfect. I had an entire pie by myself, which I usually never do, but I just could not get myself to stop. The place is very casual, you order at the counter and choose your own seat where the staff brings you the food. If you are hesitating to try this place, seriously go.<p>\\n\", \"This is simply great pizza. It is definitely not soggy and definitely not flavorless. I've eaten pizza all over the country. The dining experience is unique. You sit at shared tables. You can watch the pizza being made and it is fast. Always great pizza!<p>\\n\", \"Had the margarita pizza and added mushrooms. Light pizza with the perfect crust. The mozzarella is fresh and melts perfectly into the pie.

Also they'll re-cork it if you don't finish -- Love this\\n\\nLimited parking in the back !<p>\\n\", 'YUM \\nAnticos is our favorite in Atlanta. Possibly of anywhere. Their pizza is so incredibly tasty and one pie is more than enough to feed the two of us. Whether your visiting Atlanta or a local; this place is a MUST. And be sure to go to THIS location.<p>\\n', \"Some of the best pizza in Atlanta. It's authentic, fresh ingredients, crispy yet fluffy and flavorful crust, it is everything you could ask for in a pizza. Even the experience and atmosphere of Anticos pizza is wonderfully different. They do not have plates, only paper towels and plastic forks and knives if you find you need any. They have cups of water that you can get from the sink, it's BYOB, and they have a little bar of toppings like garlic, olive oil, peppers, and a spicy sauce. The kinky reason I am rating 4 stars instead of 5 is that the cashiers are kind of mean. The menu is in Italian so I ask a good handful of questions about the food~ they just seems uninterested and tired of answering people's questions. Overall a must go-everyone needs to try this resturant!<p>\\n\", \"This was awesome. Not only did they have multiple (delicious!!!) vegetarian options,  but also they brought out the food almost instantly. Seating can be a bit of a challenge but come toward the end of a lunch rush and you will be keenly rewarded. I would recommend the margarita or the Sophia highly. Don't forget the pickled chilis and the chili\\nPaste. So so so good. I like the fact that it's served in a giant tray to share with you and your friends.<p>\\n\", \"I could have saved myself $1500 plane ticket to Italy if I had heard about Antico sooner! I'm deducting one star because it felt very cramped inside and it was very loud. Luckily we had two strangers move to the side and gave us two seats for my and my boyfriend. There was also a very large party sitting near the entrance that we're very loud and were distracting. I didn't like that I really couldn't have a conversation. But nevertheless, I didn't talk much because I was stuffing my face with a Classic margharita pizza which far exceeded my expectations! I came here because my boyfriend has been there before and we are both huge pizza lovers! And he did not steer me wrong. Wow from the sauce to the crunchiness of the crust to being able to see them make the pizza was absolutely amazing! It was so delicious and sooo similar to the ones I've had in Venice and Florence, Italy! For all you pizza lovers out there and don't mind loud places, Antico is the place to go!<p>\\n\", \"One of the best pizza you can have in Atlanta! It can get a bit crowded but most days the wait time is usually 10 minutes or so. If you like spicy food then don't forget to get the chillies! I have had all their pizzas and highly recommend Pomodorini for the first time (because the flavors are so classic) or the Sophia which is a speciality pizza (you'll enjoy it if you like truffle oil) Capricciosa is superb too if you like mushrooms. Their pizzas never fail to deliver in terms of great crust and a yummy sauce. We usually order one pizza between two people and if you ask they can also do half and half for two different types of pizza.<p>\\n\", 'Best pizza in Atlanta and definitely the best pizza that I have ever had. The venue is very small and it is often hard to find a place to sit during busy hours, so I would not recommend for a larger group.<p>\\n', 'Great pizza!  Flavorful ingredients, tasty crust.  Been here a couple of times and not yet disappointed.<p>\\n', \"Been coming here for years and I have to say it's some delicious pizza we tend to always get the Margarita with pepperoni which comes out to 27.22 for one pizza. However, the inside of the restaurant hasn't change much, they need to offer ice water instead of having ppl get it from there tiny sink, and a few upgrades such as better quality paper towels, offer plates and try to maximize there space. on weekends and evening it can get really busy that you have to wait for a table/bench space for a while. Parking can also be a hassle. Street parking is better. For the price of one pizza they also inside to consider keeping up the place.<p>\\n\", \"Overpriced &amp; snobby. I like the atmosphere, but I always hate a cafeteria, family style style seating setup. Seating is really difficult at dinner time and it's particularly difficult if you have a large group, but if it's just the two of you, you'll likely be butt up against the patrons next to and behind you. \\nWhen it comes to pizza, I want to be able to customize my pie. You have all the ingredients, can't you just make something with all the things I want? You can easily pay over $20 for a pie here and there is really nothing special about it and in my case it's often not even the pizza I want; its a group compromise.\\nParking is a nightmare because this area is always crowded. There are stairs to navigate in the back and the front is narrow, so accessibility is an issue if you have a wheelchair or someone on crutches.\\nPeople love to regard this place as THE BEST IN ATLANTA (I think people just repeat this enough to believe it) or COMPLETELY OVERRATED. I'm in the latter camp. Yall have fun, I'll be at Felinis<p>\\n\", 'This place is awesome! We were visiting from out of town and just wanted a good pizza. Well look no further! This place has got some awesome pies. On another note, theres a gelato place across the street that goes well after a big pizza!<p>\\n', \"Was in town for a work conference and asked a couple locals what was a great spot to get some pizza. Many suggested this so I gave it a shot And I drove 30 minutes out in the traffic, sidenote 30 minutes in Atlanta is just 7 miles, once I got there the neighborhood looked a little sketchy but the place inside was very clean and really modern. Since it was so far away and I needed to pick up my husband from work I ordered ahead so it could be ready on time. Once I got there the staff was very dismissive and did not really care I had ordered ahead. They started making my order once I got there so I have to wait even longer, making me late to get back to pick up my husband. I got the pizza and must I say it looked delicious and drove back to pick up my husband. As soon as my husband got in the car he got a slice and eat the pizza, another side note he always loves pizza, but this one he said he was only eating because he hadn't ate all day. Once I stop driving I tried it for myself, the sauce was unflavored and the crust was pretty much burnt. The cheese was the best part along with the toppings. My husband said it tasted like rubber. The only reason I rate it a 2/5 is because it's better than the pizza I've had all week but not even close to the pizza I've had.<p>\\n\", \"My all time favorite pizza spot not just in Atlanta, but in America! \\nMy go-to is the margarita pizza, simple yet just enough! On my first visit, I thought I should get my own pie- but these are definitely for sharing! Antico only offers one size, but I would suggest one per two guests. \\nBYOB! You are allowed to bring any wine or beer you would like! This keeps the meal a low price, plus you choose whatever selection of drink you'd like. There's a great wine shop near by called Perrines, around westside provisions. \\nThe margarita pizza with two bottles of water was $23 including tax. Plus my bottle of wine was a gift- so this made for a perfect date night for me and my boyfriend! We try to go on a weekly basis \\nI always here of celebrities visiting and have yet to meet one there yet! Seems to be Sunday nights...Bradley  Cooper and Ludacris are two visitors from the past few months!<p>\\n\", \"Honestly, I don't think I've ever had pizza that's as good as this. They don't have many options, but they're really not necessary because they've mastered what they do have. The lasagna pizza was phenomenal and I'm still thinking about it, wishing I could go back. Pizza comes out quickly as well so once you order you don't have to wait very long. The gelato at their other place next door is also to die for. The tiramisu gelato has little bits of cookie swirled into it and is topped with a crisp waffle cookie.<p>\\n\", \"I'm not sure how the average rating is only 4 stars for this place. My husband and I make sure to go to Antico every time we come to Atlanta. We love the atmosphere - getting to watch the pizzas being made, the option of bringing in a bottle of wine if we want, and, of course, the pizza itself.\\n\\nNeapolitan style pizza, simple ingredients/toppings, and you can't go wrong with any of the menu options. Don't take it to go, eat it there for the best tasting experience (although maybe wait like three minutes before you dig in).\\n\\nWe've had the Margherita, Diavola, Sophia, and I thiiiiiiink (it was a few years ago) the Bianca. None of them disappointed us. It's a cool experience with really good, simple food. Eat pizza and then top it off with an affogato or cappuccino next door at their cafe.<p>\\n\", \"Paid $21.78 for Bianca pizza.\\n\\nBianca pizza is probably the most boring pizza order next to cheese pizza but I wanted to compare it to what I had in Italy. It's basically a 4 cheese pizza made of mozzarella, ricotta, buffalo, and pecorino.\\n\\nI went to Naples recently and remember the pizza pretty clearly. Antico isn't perfect but it's still pretty good.\\n\\nMost of the pizza I had in Italy was $8 - 10 euro for a medium size. Antico is larger and I like the fast casual places. The pizza came out pretty quick and there was barely a wait even though there was a healthy amount of people inside.  \\n\\nAntico was more oily. The crust is not as airy. The pizza was not wet enough. You couple pick up Antico with your hand and you couldn't do that in Naples. Also it was kind of overpriced.\\n\\nDespite all the dissimilarities, Antico is still probably closest to Napoli pizza I've had in Georgia. I enjoyed it very much.\\n\\nWould I come here again?\\nYes. It's a lot cheaper than flying to Naples.<p>\\n\", 'Have had the pizza here several times while in town on business. Area is nice and the food is great.<p>\\n', 'Great pizza. Closest you can get to Italian pizza in Atlanta. Cheese and dough taste amazing and authentic. I went here for my birthday and had a great time<p>\\n', \"I came here after Dave's review (One bite Barstool sports.) I would rate pizza at 6.8. The place is pretty cool. You can see them make fresh pizza in kitchen and their service is exceptionally fast. The pizza was a little pricy but worth the quality you are getting. The pizza had really good crust however it was a little floppy. I wish it was a little more crispy. Their pizza sauce was really delicious but wish they used more pizza sauce in their pizza. Overall it was a good experience.<p>\\n\", \"Came here for a bday party. The byob concept is interesting and fun. I had the diavola pizza which was very large and good. Not the BEST pizza I've ever had per se but the food was definitely good and came out quickly. I'd go back.<p>\\n\", \"Wow this is hands down the best pizza I've ever had! I cant wait to go back. It is very expensive though, so be prepared for that. I think it was beyond worth it though. My boyfriend and I had the margarita pizza and finished the whole thing in record time! \\n\\nRight across the street is a cafe by the same people, so make sure to save room for gelato or a coffee!<p>\\n\", \"Still possibly the best pizza I've ever had. A degree of freedom of so past the traditional neapolitan style pizza, which is strictly regulated by size and everything else. This has a bit of an American flair, which includes the nice soft chewy crust, vesuvio pomodoro sauce, buffalo mozzerella, etc but is at a size that can be shared with friends.\\n\\nI only came here on occassion when I was a poor undergarduate student at Georgia Tech, and I really wish I could have been making some money so I could come here more often. Area is always packed and can be difficult to find parking, and even more difficult to find a table to sit at. But they do have large-ish tables, so be brave and make some new friends while you're there.\\n\\nIf you like spicy, give the diablo a shot. Otherwise, the traditional margarita is amazing. Service is also rather quick for how busy this place can be.<p>\\n\", 'Was looking for a good pizza and I was not disappointed. Friendly staff and fun atmosphere. The pizza was served up quick and was outstanding! Definitely will be back!<p>\\n', 'Reviews speaks for itself. The quality of the pizza is amazing but the experience is better. You sit right where they make it with Italian music playing in the background. If gives you a really fun false sense of Italy<p>\\n', \"Best pizza in town!!! Always worth the wait and love the company when eating. Some people don't like community style eating but I found it was fun and inviting<p>\\n\", \"To me, this is the OG of Neapolitan pizza in Atlanta. The ingredients are so simple, but legit, so the end product is amazing. The Diavola is my favorite because it's spicy and delicious. I also love the Margherita, Lasagna, and Pomodorini pies. TBH you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. \\n\\nI will say the Sophia pizza is good but not $27 good in my opinion.\\n\\nParking can be a pain here especially on evenings and weekends, but there are several small lots around Little Italia and street parking along Hemphill and in Home Park.<p>\\n\", \"Ordered a Margarita and a Peroni and enjoyed the electric atmosphere! I love to to eat! It's everything you expect an authentic  Italian pizzeria to be!!! Crust is awesome- chewy and flavorful and toppings were tasty. I miss an option for arugula but other than that a perfect bite!!!<p>\\n\", \"Stopped by here for dinner on a recent trip to Atlanta and liked the food but not so much the vibe here. The lady that took our order was less than friendly. We told her it was our first time but she didn't have any helpful tips or anything. She just told us to order then find a place to sit. \\n\\nThe menu itself is slightly confusing. Everything comes in one size but the size wasn't indicated on the board. The descriptions were also less than helpful. \\n\\nSeating is communal and decidedly not child friendly. I looked around and saw no booster seats or high chairs. \\n\\nThe pizza came out pretty quickly after we ordered, which was a huge plus. But my daughter and husband weren't feeling the best after eating here that night. \\n\\nNot sure if I would return again if I was a local... I was surprised by the high number of positive reviews because we really didn't have the most positive experience!<p>\\n\", 'Excellent Neapolitan pizza, the crust is light, the sauce is fresh. Gio always provides a great dining experience<p>\\n', \"Extremely sexist establishment that treats their employees like trash, and got in trouble for $320k worth of unpaid wages back in 2015. Don't eat here. At all.<p>\\n\", \"Not much to say GIO is the king of yummy foods in atlanta area! Especially Pizza! It's BYOB! Fast service . I eat a whole pie by myself it's THAT good ! Kinda hard when you have a large group with seating or strollers. So be prepared or bring smaller stroller or just carry your infant . Noisy so it gives an outdoor vibe but definitely a date place .<p>\\n\", 'Antico has been my favorite pizza anywhere for a long time now. Their new pizza, the Sofia, is the best one. So much garlic goodness.<p>\\n', \"Some of the best pizza I've had. We arrived and had ordered Margherita and San Gennaro pies. While they don't offer plates, patrons are able to eat off of the pan that the pie is served on. I'd figure this is great place to gather a big group of people and catch up over some excellent food. I'd definitely recommend and plan on coming back.<p>\\n\", \"Best pizza in the Atlanta area and maybe even in the Southeast! I have been here several times and never left disappointed. Well, I was left disappointed once, but that's because my date stood me up. Not Antico's fault. I love the spicy pizza with all the meats as well as the one with the broccoli rabe on it. Note that their location at the Battery is also awesome, but I love the ambiance of the original location!<p>\\n\", \"Absolutely love this pizza place. The pizzas are always huge and taste amazing. The diavola and the San gennaro are my favorites. It's also bring your own wine here, so it's always a great time to bring friends. The only downside is that it's pretty packed most of the time, but definitely worth the wait.<p>\\n\", \"Came here with my hubby while my brother was visiting from Orlando FL. HANDS DOWN best pizza in ATL. We have been loyal to our fave place (Fellini's) which is def #2 but Antico took top spot. Amazing vibe at the restaurant and the pizza is just BOMB!<p>\\n\", \"Had to stop by here and grab a pie.  There was a minimal wait at 5pm.  The pizza came out pretty quickly.  We got the San Gennaro pizza, the most popular selling pizza.  It has sausage, caramelized onions, cherry tomatoes, and mozzarella. \\n\\nIt was delicious!  Some say it's one of the best places to get pizza in America.  It's definitely good.  I would've liked if they cut the sausage into smaller bits and had it distributed more evenly to get some in every bite.  The dough tasted a bit soft too - I think it needed an extra 1-2 minutes.  \\n\\nWould come back and try the other pies<p>\\n\", \"Antico is hands down best pizza in the US. I will debate anyone that disagrees. It's the only pizza joint that tastes like you're in Italy. And if you don't like Italian pizza, get lost.<p>\\n\", 'Antico is amazing! Yelp always steers me in the right direction and Antico was another awesome find. \\n\\nWe visited around 6pm on a Friday evening and were pleased to find there wasn\\'t a long line (wasn\\'t the same case when we were on our way out). Upon arrival, we walked up to the counter and placed our order. There were several options for Neapolitan pizzas, calzones, and salads, as well as wine, beer, and fun San Pellegrino flavors. Some of the reviews said BYOB, but I believe these might be outdated as they did have wine and beer. We were dining in, so it was important to pay attention to the number on our ticket. We made our way into the dinning room. There were several options for communal seating (high tops, traditional \"picnic\" tables, and standing tables). As we waited, we were entertained watching the staff hard at work (mixing sauce, tossing dough, and placing the pies in the traditional ovens) and listening to upbeat Italian music. \\n\\nIt wasn\\'t long until our number was called and a large 14-inch pizza was delivered on an over-sized cookie sheet. It was exactly as I had hoped and looked AND tasted like traditional Italian pizza, only bigger - in Italy the pies are made for one person, but here my spouse and I split a pie and still had half for a doggy bag. I loved the accessory/condiment bar - olive oil, peppers, freshly grated cheese, and fresh basil - all wonderful accompaniments to the pizzas. We ordered the Diavola and it was simply delicious - spicy, for those who appreciate the heat. \\n\\nAntico was a fabulous find nestled in a super cute Atlanta neighborhood. Even though I live a few hours away, I am definitely already making plans for my return visit.<p>\\n', 'My cousin brought us here straight from the airport because he knows my love for pizza and I was not disappointed. Not going to lie I was many expecting to be as good as it was being that I live in the tri state area but the pizza here definitely can compete with and margarita style pizza in NYC.<p>\\n', 'Definitely my favorite pizza in the world. I would come to Atlanta just for this. The crust is perfection. Sauces are on point. Toppings are high quality. The combo is just a mouth watering yum.<p>\\n', 'Yummy pizza!!!\\nThis is how pizza was originally done..made by hand with fresh, simple and wholesome ingredients.\\nOpen kitchen, you literally can talk to pizza man and see pizzas made right in front of you. You can smell the fire cooking the crust, the fresh basil radiating the air, the hmmmm of good conversations as people drink their BYOB.\\nMust try! We will be back!<p>\\n', \"Eat here! You will not be sorry! My favorite part of going to the ATL recently has been having a foodie in my life that's lived there a while and continues to take me to new places. This is one of them and I really enjoyed the pie! \\n\\nIt's busy here because people know what's up, it's a little hot in there because they're making delicious pie, and it's a little pricey because.. well because it's worth it! I split a pie with someone on my way to the airport to jet out of town. My mistake.. should have eaten here earlier so that I could have gotten one for later. Life is all about choices I guess... apparently I can't trust myself.. \\n\\nMargherita pie with the sausage, you can thank me later.. Although I'd bet you couldn't go wrong with literally anything else on the menu. Give me long enough and I'll probably be able to back that up with words, I plan to go back and try more and more. OMG I need a gym membership or something.. Anyway, parking is tight, seating is tight, but I have a feeling you will make due. It really is good pie!<p>\\n\", 'Consistently delicious pizza in an open-style BYO-anything (no corking fees!). If the inside is full (it usually is) you can head across the street to the outside patio by the gelato place (which is also delicious).<p>\\n', 'Wow! So good but a bit over priced the margarita pizza is just like the one from Italy! The bianca pizzas are ok but I love red sauce!<p>\\n', \"Simply put, this is the best pizza I've ever had. I've traveled to Rome and throughout Italy, and I've lived in New York for four years, and I can honestly say that this pizza place me on another level. I had the artichoke pizza with prosciutto and it's just an amazing burst of flavors with every bite. I especially enjoyed how soft the dough was and how everything just seemed so fresh and real. I still can't believe that a pizza this good comes from Atlanta and it's one of those special places that you know should only exist in one place to make it unique among other pizzas. Though I did not try other  kinds of pizza here, I know that the quality is just as good because I saw how many customers were enjoying the pizza. They all looked so happy! Though the restaurant is small, that adds to the charm and the pizza is just done so amazingly that I know that when I'm in Atlanta, I will definitely pick up one or two more pizzas here! Definitely come here if you want to be blown away by Pizza!<p>\\n\", \"I've been here twice and have tried 2 pizzas - the Verdura and Margherita DOP. The Verdura is a white pizza and was ok. As I was eating it, I was wondering why everyone was hyping up Antico's. I needed marinara sauce to enjoy it as it was a white pizza. It helped, but it was still missing something.\\n\\nThen I tried my friend's Margherita DOP pizza and understood my mistake. I ordered the wrong pizza. The Margherita DOP was perfect. Thin, cheesy, and really flavorful. I may have gone overboard with the garlic, but I didn't care.\\n\\nService was better in the back than in the front. I was waiting to place my order and when I thought it was my turn, the employee hopped on another register and helped someone who should have gone after me. Not sure what that was about...<p>\\n\", \"While I was doing my research on food places in Atlanta, I came across an article from the Business Insider and it named Antico Pizza as one of best pizza joints in 10 metropolitan cities in the US (http://www.businessinsider.com/the-best-pizza-joints-in-10-us-cities-2013-10?op=1). Not only that, 2,500+ reviews with a solid 4-star average Yelp rating? That certainly grabbed my attention. In fact, I drove all the way from Asheville, NC (3+ hour drive) and my first stop in Atlanta was this pizza joint. \\n\\nAntico Pizza has a really tiny private parking lot, but my friend and I got here 20 minutes before the closing time and the lot was pretty empty. I have heard that Atlanta has one of the higher crime rates in America and the very first thing I saw upon entering the pizza joint was a security guard standing at the front entrance. The menu is very simple with 10 pre-customized pizzas (5 Rosso [tomato sauce] and 5 Bianca [no tomato sauce - slightly sprinkled with salt and olive oil]) to choose from. The one I wanted to order is Margherita D.O.P., but I couldn't remember what I wanted to order and just let my friend ordered the meatiest pizza - San Gennaro. After you place your order, just find one of communal tables and wait until someone yells your order number. There's a condiment station with garlic, chili, and Parmesan cheese.\\n\\n***\\n\\nSan Gennaro (salsiccia, dolce piccante pepper, bufala, cipolline - $22): It was big enough to share between two adults. Overall this was a very meaty and cheesy thin crust pizza with fluffy &amp; airy dough and slightly burnt crust, and fresh out of the ovens. I liked everything about this pizza ... except the toppings. So I ended up dumping all of fresh garlic on top of my pizza.\\n\\n***\\n\\nEven though I like few other pizza places (e.g. Pizzeria Bianco in Phoenix and Piece Brewery and Pizzeria in Chicago) more than Antico Pizza, Antico Pizza is still one of the better pizza joints that I have tried.<p>\\n\", 'I have never been to Italy, but this place is as close as it will get! When you walk inside, it is actually quite small. They have a few tables in their back room where you can see all of the cooks preparing the pizza! It\\'s awesome being able to see what you are about to eat being cooked! The overall feel of the restaurant is quite homey, since it is so small it feels like you are basically eating with a bunch of friends not strangers. \\n\\nTheir menu is quite simple, although a lot of the ingredients are in Italian. Everything on their menu is pizza, so even tho it says \"lasagna,\" it isn\\'t what you are thinking, it is an actual pizza that tastes like a lasagna. This is the pizza I ordered and fell in love with, every bite tasted like a warm homey gooey delicious cheesy lasagna dish. The pizza came out quite promptly, waited 10 mins tops. I would eat here again in a heartbeat. In fact, I think Antico\\'s should make it\\'s way down to Austin, Texas so that I can make eating here a weekly thing! ;)<p>\\n', 'They only think I didnt like was that I can as many topping as I want but the pizza is amazing<p>\\n', 'A bit on the pricey side in my opinion, but definitely worth a try. This place is worth the hype as the pizza is as fresh as it gets. They have a nice group style seating with BYOB vibe and if you go during popular times you can expect to wait.

On the side they have a bunch of pizza condiments which you should definitely try out.<p>\\n', \"I have been to Antico more than 3+ times but never had the chance to write a review until now. I recently visited them again and so my memory is now refreshed. My last two visits I ordered the following:\\n\\n-Margherita ($20) \\n-San Gennaro ($22) \\n-Cannoli ($4) \\n\\nThe San Gennaro is hands down my favorite pizza from Antico. I love the mixture of onions, sausage and mozzarella. So gooood. I usually eat around two slices max at other pizza place but oh man..I definitely eat way more than 2 slices. Highly highly recommend. I also see on the board that the San Gennaro is an award wining pizza from Antico...and I can see why. \\n\\nThe Margherita is a classic pizza. You can add sausage, pepperoni, mushroom and other toppings for an additional charge if you like. I usually like to add the pepperoni. Great flavor. \\n\\nThe Cannoli, which is new I think since I haven't seen this before was really good as well. You get to choose from coconut, chocolate chips, and two other flavor I believe. I would recommend this. \\n\\nOverall, I live near Antico so I will definitely come back again for the San Gennaro. Yum. :)<p>\\n\", \"Incredible pizza- a must visit if you're in Atlanta. I've been here many times and it's never disappointed. Today we went with the Sophia and a Margherita with Pepperoni, and they were perfect. I also really enjoy their Diavola pizza- just enough spice. Can't wait for our next visit.<p>\\n\", \"Great pizza! True Italian pizza. They are one size and pretty big! I prefer to pick it up bc parking is horrible. If you eat there the seating area isn't impressive but they cook the pizzas in the same room, which some might find interesting.<p>\\n\", 'I think most of the popularity of this place comes from the location rather than the pizza itself. Nothing absolutely special about it if you really know authentic Italian pizza.<p>\\n', \"The best pizza I've ever had in the south hands down. I did a pizza tour through New Haven, Connecticut one summer because I'm fat and I love pizza. The pizza at Antico's could practically fit right in there. I judge a pizza a lot on how well the dough can be eaten by itself and everything about this pizza can stand alone but goes fantastic together. They do offer carry out, but you still have to wait for it to be made in store because they do like to keep everything fresh. They make a set amount of dough every day and close when they run out. This pizza is very authentically Italian.<p>\\n\", 'Found this gem of a Pizzeria a few nights ago after reading yelp reviews. We decided to give it a try on Sunday night...just remember on Sunday they close at 9PM.....so if you want an end of weekend pizza pie make sure you go early....We did street parking which was fairly easy and it is a very small restaurant with a large \"cafeteria\" style eating hall....You basically order your pie, get a number and sit down....very simple...They offer all canned or bottled drinks, quick service and great pizza. Keep up the great work...Looking forward to going back soon!<p>\\n', \"I've avoided this place on Saturdays because I've heard about the huge crowds and I know how small the restaurant is, but my friend really wanted to try Antico so we ended up coming on a VERY busy Saturday afternoon. We had to circle the block a few times and almost gave up, but we eventually lucked up on a parking space.\\n\\nThe line was long, but moved very quickly. We ordered the San Gennaro and two glasses of Cabernet. Although they sell wine now, they'll still allow you to bring your own bottle. Seating was sparse. Two people left the front countertop just as we finished our placing our order, so we grabbed those seats. The food came out surprisingly quickly. \\n\\nI am happy to report that the San Gennaro remains my favorite pizza of all time! It comes with a light drizzle of marinara, onions, mozzarella cheese, sweet peppers and Italian sausage. It's divine! The thin chewy crust is unmatched. I also like the selection of complimentary toppings they offer that include olive oil, peppers and garlic.<p>\\n\", 'Pizza is always great! I typically get the Margarita pizza here with the roasted peppers they offer inside.\\nGreat place to eat anytime of the day!<p>\\n', \"I fear the day I have to go to another pizza joint in Atlanta. The pizzas here are superb. Excellent. Salivation causing. If I was sentenced to death, a slice of the Margherita would be included in my last meal--among the other several foods I'd ask for. If I'm gonna die, I wanna die with the most sacred items INSIDE ME. Anyways the community seating is awesome, it's comforting to be around people that appreciate Antico for the gifts it cooks up in those brick pizza ovens and expediently serves to us (I use expediently a lot, but forreal I sat down, went to go get additional toppings.. and as I was walking back, I saw my pizza gracefully walking with me). Tender, slightly charred crust. Thick chunks of mozzarella. Only a few basil leaves tho  Every bite is as satisfying as the last.

As someone who does take their pizza pretty seriously, I would say it was good -- great even!! -- but not my favorite.<p>\\n\", \"I heard this restaurant was rated one of the best pizzerias in the country and the highest rated in Georgia.

You order at the front when you walk in and there are two dining rooms in the back. No plates or utensils. There is however paper towel rolls that serve duo purpose... plate and napkin. \\n\\nThe pizzas were good, but the best? Debatable. The major issue that made dinner not enjoyable was the temperature. It was so HOT in the dining room. I don't know if the AC was broken that evening or if that was the norm. Either way, it made dinner miserable and not enjoyable as everyone at the table was sweating profusely. It also didn't help that the tables were so close to one another. It was hot, humid, and extremely loud. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again.<p>\\n\", 'Solid margarita pizza. There\\'s not another spot like it in the city.

This is what's great about this place. They made sure that what they have is the best. The pizza dough reminded me of my years in Naples. The pizza is great. Everything fresh. I don't eat meat but I did notice that they make and cut the pepperoni in house. European style seating. Then go across the street and have some delicious gelato. The salted caramel and strawberry was a great combination. If pizza is your thing this is a go to spot. We WILL be coming back!<p>\\n\", \"What's better than some Antico Pizza on a Saturday night in Atlanta. Corner location with parking.  The pizza is ordered by the pie and it's delicious. Fresh ingredients and really good crust. A must if your are near Georgia Tech.<p>\\n\", \"I've heard rave reviews about this place but honestly the pizza was SO OILY and just ok.

Amazing pizza to say the least.  \\nI had the Margherita with sausage, so vey delicious but I don't think you could go wrong with any of the options.  \\nI do hate they don't have salads, especially since the one next door is so good.  \\nAfter you order you go into a big room with picnic tables to find a place to sit.

It's loud and not the place to go if you're looking for conversation but at the same time it's fun.  \\nDon't forget to top your fresh pie with some of their fresh Parmesan cheese!<p>\\n\", 'Be advice, eat at your own risk. Honestly this is one of the best pizza franchises in America. I\\'m giving it one star because the employees are not Hygienic. I went to the restroom next to the ice cream parlor that antico own\\'s and I was waiting for the restroom and one of the employees came out of it. I went to the restroom and they did not have \"SOAP\". The employee who works making pizza did not wash his hands. I am disgusted to say the least. Using the restroom and not washing your hands? Damn barbarians. The health department needs to inspect this location and the manager needs to do his or her job. But the pizza was fantastic.<p>\\n', \"It's been in our bucket list to have a bite from Antico since the day we came to Atlanta. \\n\\nFinally made it and it was worth the trip!!! Hot  pizza from the wood fire oven yum!!! Loved it 5/5  \\n\\nDon't forget to get a gelato from Antico Cafe for your sweet tooth.<p>\\n\", 'I love Antico pizza. The crust is delightfully thin and crispy. The cheese is not overwhelming and the toppings are although limited, very well paired. I can easily eat half a large pizza in one seating. My current favorite is the san gennaro. I love how the sweet peppers balance the salty sausage. Best part about this location is the BYOB. Make sure to come snag a table early if you have a group. This place gets packed fast (although they do move the line fast too)! Make sure to go next door and grab a cannoli at their cafe!\\n\\nParking: Easy. In the back and side parking.<p>\\n', \"I've been here a couple times now when I visit Atlanta, and it is a pretty unique place and definitely one of the more popular places that I would definitely recommend trying. I have brought some of my other friends here before from out of town, and they said that it is the best pizza they have ever had.\\n\\nIt does get really busy and there are no hosts. Seating is first come first serve, so as soon as you get in, try and reserve your seats right away or you won't have a spot. The seating is really cool too, because you can see exactly what's going on in the kitchen, and you can eat on a kitchen table when it is really busy.<p>\\n\", 'Oh man!!! The best pizza i have ever tasted. If you think about it, the ingredients are just simple and can easily find in the market. But the flavor and the sauce makes it super delicious. I would recommend this to everyone who will visit to Atlanta<p>\\n', \"The best pizza I've ever had in my life! Even better than going to Italy itself (although I always ordered pasta there). Even though I always want to try new pizzas, I always find myself sticking to what I know: the Diavola and the Lasagna. The Diavola has the perfect kick of spice with the peppers and the Lasagna has the most amazing ricotta cheese!!! I feel like you really can't go wrong with anything you get here!<p>\\n\", 'What.an.experience ugh! I def don\\'t understand the hype about this place. Where do I begin?\\n\\nWhen we first arrived we went to the wrong building...twice. How does one do that? From a lack of direction, confusing signs and about 4-5 different restaurants under one business owner. We brought two bottles of wine and awkwardly assumed that we were at the correct spot and sat down in the outdoor area. The owner came over and told us that the byob section was in the other building so we couldn\\'t sit there. He was the best part about the experience. He was so nice and gave us great suggestions and apologized profusely for the inconvenience. \\n\\nWhen we went to the correct spot I was instantly turned off. I expected it to be a little more formal I guess? Not super formal but just like a normal place where you can sit at your own table and sip your wine and eat your food in peace, ya know? Absolutely not! They have family style tables and you have to sit next to complete strangers. The manager gave us a great suggestion to find your table before you order so that you can find a table and won\\'t have to stand and eat your pizza, thank God he told us that. It was kinda busy and we had to wait for a table, and then track down a bus boy to wipe it after just standing in front of someone\\'s else\\'s empty plates and napkins for 5 minutes. \\n\\nUsually I wouldn\\'t mind the family style tables too much but the couple next to us were soooo awkward. They were way too friendly and talked our ear off. When me and my bestie tried to toast, they were like, \"yes! Let\\'s toast\" and shoved their dirty cups next to our cups. To make matters worse, they ended up getting into an argument and asked for our advice about their argument. We felt so uncomfortable and tried to eat our food as soon as possible because they continued to argue the whole time. \\n\\nWhen our food came it looked delicious. I ordered the Bianca and what a mistake that was. It tasted like plain bread and had 0 flavor, at all, none, nata, zilch. Get the point? My friend ordered the Lasagna pizza and she thought it was \"cool\", def nothing to rant and rave about. Don\\'t order the Bianca! I rather go to Dominos! It was that bad. Also, there were so many little nats flying around or pizza. My friend had one nat into her last cup of wine. \\n\\nI just won\\'t come here again. It\\'s just not my type of place, but to each is own.<p>\\n', 'Delicious and fast! Get the Lasagna pizza you wont be disappointed! Everytime I come here I get good consistant pizza.<p>\\n', \"BEST PIZZA IN ATLANTA. \\nHad the San gennaro and the margherita pizza. The San gennaro was the best pizza I've ever had!<p>\\n\", 'Best pizza ever! \\nBut the cashier ist the worst ever! Been coming in for yer and her attitude is unmatched! Never once had she been nice or smiled! And I know she is nice to others but customers service includes being nice to everyone not just who you like to be nice to! Horrible and she is always there no matter what time of the day<p>\\n', \"Clearly some of the best pizza in the city, but the eating atmosphere--even though I get they're going for a european vibe--is nowhere near what I'd expect for this price point. I'd much prefer to sit down in a comfortable booth or private table vs. sitting at a picnic table with co-diners I don't know.\\n\\nWhat I will say is having the open kitchen is SUPER cool and feeds the experience to the hilt. But it's a mixed review from me because the sit-down part of the restaurant really makes no sense to me.<p>\\n\", 'We ordered the lasagna pizza and the prosciutto pizza. The crust is thin and cooked to perfection! One of the best pizzas ever!<p>\\n', \"This place is great! Especially to go with a group of friends or family. It's family style, the pizzas are decently sized. I tried the Diavola and the Bianca. I preferred the Diavola and would recommend that one. Very flavorful and tasty. It's also BYOB, which is a nice touch.<p>\\n\", 'Great wood oven baked pizza with quality ingredients. The service is quick even when the place is busy. Recommended!<p>\\n', \"Antico is faaaaantastic! I am a fan of the San Gennaro. The sweet peppers that they put on that pizza are magic! This is the original location, it has long tables and communal style eating. I crave it regularly. \\n\\nFor pizza and beer, Antico is where it's at!<p>\\n\", 'Antico was a great pizza spot in my local neighborhood. Open concept, shared seating with other guests (cafeteria style), and bomb pizza. A small menu to choose from, but huge flavor profile. Could be very difficult for large groups especially during crowded times, but worked for just two or three folks. Best pizza I have had in Atlanta so far, but not topping my favorite pizza in New York yet! Check this place out!<p>\\n', 'THIS PLACE IS AMAZING. The pizzas are very authentic and taste great. They come out fast and delicious. Only thing is the main eating place is loud, but other than that 5 STARS!!<p>\\n', \"Plain and simple, Antico Pizza dishes up what must be some of the best pizza in Atlanta, and it was very much on par with some of my favorite spots in the country. \\n\\nStar 1: How were the service and atmosphere?\\n\\nIf you've been to DeSano Pizza at any of their locations nationwide Antico will look familiar, with its counter ordering and backroom that offers a clear view of the cooks and ovens. It's a great setup, and the service was fast and friendly. Star Granted. \\n\\nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\\n\\nFor $22.00, my coworker and I got a full Diavola pizza, which turned out to be more than enough to cover a dinner for two. That obviously maths out to $11.00 per person, which was more than reasonable for a great pizza dinner. Star Granted. \\n\\nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\\n\\nThis was truly excellent pizza, with thick and flavorful crust, cheese than maintained its shape bite after bite, and a great combination of toppings in the form of pepperonis and flavorful spicy peppers. Game. Set. Match. Dual Stars Granted. \\n\\nStar 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?\\n\\nThis is a close one, but I ever so slightly prefer DeSano Pizza to Antico, and Antico falls just short of my top spot Tony's in San Francisco. No Star Granted.<p>\\n\", \"Holy yum. Wow, wow, wow. No other pizza tastes the same after eating here.\\n\\nWe came on a Saturday around 11:30. They do not open until noon, so we had to wait in line outside. They brought out a sample pizza for all of us in line to have, which I greatly appreciated. It was so delicious it made me want to beat down the door even more. \\n\\nOnce we were inside we quickly found a seat because there is little seating inside. It is great to sit at communal tables with loud, instrumental music blaring while the employees are tossing pizza dough into the air. \\n\\nWe had the mushroom truffle pizza that was on special. It was close to $30, but holy hell it was worth every penny. You definitely got the truffle taste. Everything was so fresh. I often feel skimped on the truffle, not this time.\\n\\nI also love the fresh Parmesan, peppers, and other ingredients they leave out for you to dress every pizza bite with. \\n\\nProbably the best pizza I've ever had.<p>\\n\", \"Best pizza I've ever had. Been around the world, across Italy, from Rome to Naples, Amalfi, Capri San Marino,  Pisa, Cinque Terre, Verona, Milan, Venice and more; and never and NOWHERE have we had pizza as good as Antico's. The quality of the ingredients, the dough, the toppings, the ambiance. I don't even really like pizza and I can't get enough of Antico. Free parking if you can find a spot. The line may be long, but it moves quickly. Service is fast. They have beer and wine. Eat your pizza anywhere-- inside, outside by Amalfi bar and gelato place across the street, on a stoop or in your car.\\n--- you're welcome!<p>\\n\", 'I loved the pizza here. I got the spicy one and it was amazing. The kitchen area where you sit was really cool and I loved the casual vibes. The front desk people were in a heated conversation so it was kind of awkward when I ordered I felt like I was interrupting. But overall I loved the pizza and the whole place.<p>\\n', \"Wow! Best pizza I've ever had! We got a margarita pizza and added pepperoni and it did not disappoint! The restaurant was crowded and we did have to wait in line for a few, but it's well worth it!<p>\\n\", \"I've been to Antico pizza a number of times now. I have heard of people waiting in long lines but I never have. I walk right up to a short line and order. The pizza is usually ready by the time I sit down. It's community seating. The pizzas are traditional Italian so you might be upset not to find all the regular styles pizzas you might try elsewhere. They have a bar with all the extras you can put on the pizza. We have been back and will be back again.<p>\\n\", \"All hell 5 stars... usually I try restaurants more than once to give them 5 stars but hey it's BYOB with an open large space with really good pizza.  Ordered the lasagna pizza and it was delightful. I kno great pizza when I taste it. Bread/ crust, sauce and toppings were superb and matched well.  If you need a more in depth review of the place just check out Liz . P comments/ review<p>\\n\", \"I had a simple margherita pizza, and it was absolutely delicious! Simple yet tasteful. \\n\\nJust a side note; it took them less than 10 minutes to make my pizza?!! I mean I'm sure the base is pre-made, but damn, even a frozen pizza takes more than 10mins have ready!<p>\\n\", \"Sooo... this place may not be for me. I visited this place because someone told me that he drove a few additional hours just to stop by this pizza place again. We ordered San Gennaro, which came with salsiccia, dolce piccante pepper, bufala, and cipolline. We all liked this one much better than the other one. The other pizza that we had was Diavola. Diavola came with spicy sopressata, pepperonata, and bufala. I think San Gennaro is worth trying; however, I personally won't recommend Diavola. It was also pretty spicy to me. Our pizza crust was way too burnt for both pizza - I doubt that's how they should be. This definitely made the pizza taste not as great... \\n\\nAntico seemed to be a popular hang out place - saw many people brought alcohol on their own. Overall, it was an okay experience for me and the pizza was priced on the expensive side. I am not sure I'd be coming again.<p>\\n\", \"Antico is easily the best pizza in the city and they were the original to have the Neapolitan ovens in Atlanta. Plus it's byob so that's a huge bonus! \\n\\nThe lasagna pizza is to die for especially if you love ricotta on your pizza like me. The San Gennaro is another must try, don't be intimidated by the peppers bc they are sweet perfection! \\n\\nFor dessert the cannolis are amazing or you can always walk across the street to their amazing gelato place.\\n\\nI also love that you can walk up to the kitchen and get toppings like fresh basil, peppers, garlic, Parmesan, etch for your za<p>\\n\", \"You're downtown and craving pizza or maybe just good food that the people of Atlanta enjoy eating. Might I throw a suggestion out there? Antico Pizza is the way to go!\\n\\nJust about a 10 min uber ride from the Marriott Marquis, Antico is located in a semi residential area. It's a cool little innocuous building that if you're not looking hard enough for, you'll miss it! We got a tip to eat here from the locals so we said, hey why not?\\n\\nWe ended up ordering about 10 pizzas. Don't let the size of the pizza in the picture fool you. These are good sized pizzas and me being a big eater... skipping lunch... exercising that day, I couldn't hold down more than a pizza and a slice (just to give you a scale to go by!). They have a short menu and there are no substitutions. That's your first indication that they are committed to their pizzas. Love the dough and the flavorful topping combinations that they have. I ended up with the San Gennaro (a sausage/pepper pizza) delish! and the Sophia (love the truffle oil!). They completed each other very well but retrospectively I really should have shared with another person.\\n\\nThe best thing to do is to call your order in and then come and pick it up. They do have seating available with large tables in the area where they actually make the pizza which is cool. However they do not take reservations and they do get busy. They make your pizzas when you call and then when you arrive they pop it in the oven to ensure that you're taking home hot pizzas!\\n\\nThey have a limited small parking lot outside and they open until they run out of dough... which is I'm not sure what time. Love this place and would highly recommend this to anyone! I'd come back!<p>\\n\", \"Pizza is really good, but I'm not sure if it is good enough to make up for the cons. Atmosphere is HOT and hectic. I don't mind communal tables, but just be in the mindset of making new friends beforehand. \\nStaff was rude and unaccommodating. Came with 2 kids. One wanted pepperoni, one didn't. No kids pizzas. Only a large...AND they tell me they can't leave the pepperoni off half. They tell me I can order 2 pizzas at $26 a pop for 2 7 year old kids! Won't be back. There are other good pizza places who aren't so popular that they don't have time to take care of their customers<p>\\n\", \"Best pizza place I've been outside California. I don't know if the brimg everything from Italy but you can taste all ingredients are good quality. These guys know how to make authentic Italian pizza. Lasagna and Capricciosa are simply magnificent. You gotta try the spicy spread as well.<p>\\n\", \"Best restaurant! The atmosphere was amazing, you get your pizza and drinks in the front, then the pizza comes asap, amazing service. However, if you chose not to buy a drink you have to get water from the sink...Now, this would be a downside to most people's meals, but as a professional water tester, this was just an opportunity. I've gotta say Atlanta Georgia you've done it again, that was by far the best water I've tasted, and trust me I've had a glass or two. The whole meal was great overall, the pizza was good, the atmosphere, and of course the water.<p>\\n\", \"Thin and chewy, that's how I like my pizza. The Diavola is my go-to pizza. As hard as I try to venture out to other items on the menu I just can't say no to the Diavola. This is pizza that most Domino and Papa John's customers wouldn't even recognize other than its shape. You order what's on the menu and you love it. Don't act like a rube and try adding and subtracting toppings, it doesn't work like that. The open view of the kitchen makes fun in addition to delicious. When you're done, walk across the road and get an authentic gelato. I have driven over one-hundred miles in a round-trip just to satisfy my Antico craving.<p>\\n\", \"Why 4 stars? Because the pizza was enjoyable, but maybe my expectations were a bit too high.\\n\\n   ---   ---   ---\\n\\nYelp Atlanta celeb, Jonathan T has plenty of faults - too many to list here, in fact. But when it comes to his opinions on food, I put total blind faith in him. He's taken me to some amazing restaurants in Atlanta, and so when I'm in town to visit him, I enjoy just being told where to go and what to eat. \\n\\nHe'd told me about Antico Pizza a few times, but we just never had the opportunity to check it out, until my most recent visit. He considers it, by far, the best pizza in Atlanta, so I was really stoked to try it out.\\n\\nMy personal verdict? Solid pizza, bu not necessarily a place I'd go out of my way to return to on a future visit to Atlanta. With over 2,500 reviews, they obviously don't need me and have done quite well for themselves! But my review goes along with the 4-star consensus: I'm a fan, but it didn't make me want to climb a mountain and profess my love while holding a megaphone powerful enough for all of Atlanta to hear. (Yes, that is the exact feeling I get from the nearly 1,000 5-star reviews I've written in the past.)\\n\\nMaybe it was Jon's hype, but I'd like to think I put that aside and judged this pizza on its own merit. He's hyped up other places in the past, which resulted in the aforementioned mountaintop desire (Fat Matt's, I'm lookin' at you.)<p>\\n\", 'Amazing pizza and authentic atmosphere. Very quick service. Would recommend as dine in or take away.<p>\\n', \"Anticos.. how have I not reviewed. Please come eat a classic margherita pizza here and get a taste of authentic napoletana pizza. This pizza takes me back to the south of Italy &amp; has my heart so far in the south east.  The sauce is so fresh and robust and pulls the whole pizza together from the perfectly thin chewy blistered crust to the cheesy top. Get whatever pizza you want but you HAVE to try the traditional margherita if you come here to get the true simplistic taste of Italy. I love how they have minced fresh garlic, olive oil, Calabrian peppers, pepper flakes, parm, s&amp;p at the front where they make the pizzas so you can make your own dipping sauce which is really icing on the cake. I love mixing a little of the chili oil with olive oil, garlic, salt &amp; pepper to make a dipping sauce. The Parmesan cheese is delicious and I've used leftovers to throw into pasta! Everything is so fresh. The pizza is perfect if you eat it there or if you get it to go! The place gets pretty packed but it's worth the wait! It's family style dining set up so everybody just grab a seat and share a table! Love it!!<p>\\n\", \"9:20 on a Wednesday and the service is slow and the tables are filthy. When this place first open it was on point now it's a pathetic joke.<p>\\n\", \"Love this place! My husband and I tried it at the battery the first time and every location is so good! I've had the more than one of the pizzas and they're all amazing! The service is very welcoming and will explain any questions you have.<p>\\n\", \"I went here on a business trip to Atlanta after having seen the pizza guy's review of this place on YouTube. I've been wanting to try it for a couple of years but honesty I was pretty disappointed. For starters, the area doesn't feel that safe. Secondly, the pizza was good - very good - but not great...nothing to go out of your way for. What really got to me was when I was getting ready to leave and grabbed a to-go pizza box from their stack of them in the main dining room. I opened the pizza box at our table and a very large/grandaddy long leg was crawling around inside. Hey I get it, you can't control everything. But ew, gross. All in all, not terrible, but I probably won't go back.<p>\\n\", \"I adore antico!!! It is by far the best pizza place in Atlanta! It is my highlight of the week since we are going there every weekend, mostly on Sunday nights. Yes it is busy and crowded but it is all worth it. The dough is amazing and the toppings are always great. Try it and you'll love it and believe me, as you get the first bite you know you found what you were always looking for. \\n\\nFor me, the only downside is that you cannot count on the 'quality' of your pizza to be consistent. Some days you are getting the dough like it's supposed to be for a pizza napoletana and a perfect ratio of toppings in perfect shape - heavenly delicious. But as the dough is baked very thin, some days you'll end up with pieces falling apart and the toppings all over the place and not enough tomato sauce. That's maybe because the pizza bakers aren't always the same or the might not get the shape right. The two pictures are the perfect example.<p>\\n\", 'My first time here and ordered the Margherita pizza with pepperoni as well as the Sophia.  We sat across the street at the cafe and the pizza was out in a flash it seemed!  Atmosphere was fun and the patio was busy.  I enjoyed the Margherita pizza but the Sophia was not my favorite.  $27 for a pizza seems like a lot too.  \\n\\nAfter pizza, I ordered gelato- Peanut Butter Cup.  It was smooth and creamy, very good!  Also ordered Caramel Cheesecake.  The cheesecake was very dense and rich, only a few bites and we were done.  \\n\\nWe were a party of 4 and took home half a pizza and the cheesecake.<p>\\n', 'Delicious!!! In a great area Battery park-quick service and delicious pizza! We had pizza and calzones very tasty<p>\\n', \"What can I say. The pizza is just magic. And this particular location has a warming feel where everyone is eating pizza happily in the school's cafeteria. Park in the back and they allow BYOB. So bring your Chianti and come try one of the best Neapolitan pizza.<p>\\n\", \"I consider the pizza here the best I've ever had anywhere outside of Naples, Italy. The crust was chewy, smoky from the wood fired oven and gooey in the center. Perfect! As in authentic Italian pizza - the way it's supposed to be.\\n\\nWe were up for the Georgia Tech homecoming and wanted to have a relaxed family meal close to campus. It wasn't cheap, but the ingredients were very fresh and tasty, the tomato sauce was rustic and traditional. \\n\\nThe Margerhita is the best one hands down. Pistachio gelato from across the street for dessert in the courtyard. Just wow! \\n\\nMy only complaint is the mozzarella was good, but I have had better and I hope that for the price of dining here the management considers upgrading the cheese to what I have come to expect from Italian establishments. \\n\\nYou must try this place if you desire an excellent, delicious pizza and great atmosphere. I will definitely be back.<p>\\n\", \"Really fun atmosphere being able to see the chefs cooking your food. Seating is open and makes it fun to sit next to total strangers and strike up a conversation.  \\n\\nFood is great. Pizza dough tastes fresh and even the pizza crust tastes yummy!! You can help yourself to some free toppings like garlic, cheese, red peppers and some really hot peppers. \\n\\nService is fast and super friendly. \\n\\nParking bough is limited so carpool if you can if you're with a big party!<p>\\n\", \"This is really good pizza for Atlanta, however it didn't satisfy my pizza craving. We had the Margherita, the San Gennaro, and the Diavola. My favorite was the San Gennaro and that would get 4 stars in my opinion. \\n\\nThe pizzas we ordered came out right after we sat down. My friend told me they bake them at almost 700 degrees which explains why they came out so fast.\\n\\nI didn't like the crust because I felt there was too much crust and it was too thick. It could have been more cooked and crunchy at the bottom. I think they could have used more toppings as well.<p>\\n\", 'Antico Pizza in Atlanta... I feel like this is a tough one because although the pizza is VERY good, i\\'m not entirely sure i\\'d go back? When I go places to eat i\\'m not only looking at \"is it good\", i\\'m looking at the overall experience! Was the food good, was the staff friendly, was the inside inviting and a fun place to eat, does it have stress-free parking? The little things that add to an amazing experience in my book. My wife and I ordered the LARGE LASAGNA PIZZA which comes with meatballs, ricotta and romano which cost me $21. The pizza is HUGE and has a decent amount of cheese and meatballs. The crust is nice and chewy but with a crusty side while the slice is on the thinner side, so it will flop if you grab a slice and not hold it up with 2 hands. I wish the sauce had a bit more flavor, but that\\'s just how I like my pizza, with a bit more kick! Parking is so-so... small 4-5 car parking on the front with slightly larger parking on the other side. It is adjacent to a street where you can park for free. There is also an ice cream place across the street where you can park but all of these spaces get busy quick if you come during busy hours. The inside is spacious but it gets very very busy, so seating may either not be available or you may have to wait for a bit. The pizza does come out extremely fast though, so whether they are busy or not, you\\'ll get your pizza fast. The atmosphere may be a bit too fast paced for me at the end of the day. No table was available for us to sit at so we ended up on a side window looking counter near the door with people coming in and out and waiting on tables. It got HOT really quick with the sun right on us through the window, so when I ran out of my bottled drink I was a bit sad. The good news is there is an ice cream place right across the street that Anticos has signs inside pointing towards to telling the crowd to go there next, it\\'s called Illy. Good gelato inside an air conditioned place, perfect timing! Maybe Antico would be better if I lived closer or if I found a time they were not so busy? it would be nice to relax and enjoy your slice as you had a conversation with friends and family... but it\\'s too loud in there and too crowded. Am I getting old!? I\\'ll probably go back... did I mention the pizza is really good??<p>\\n', \"This is one of the most unique pizza spots I have ever been to! The vibe is so relaxed and fun (which you can really see in the people working there)! Seating may be a bit of a challenge to find, but as long as you keep an eye out it'll open up. In addition to the amazing selection of pizzas, this restaurant allows you to bring your own wine to enjoy with your food! The sights, smells, and friendly faces definitely make this one of the coolest dining experiences I've ever had!<p>\\n\", 'If you are looking for a no frills, all about the food experience, look no further! We stopped in for lunch this afternoon and there was no wait. I have eaten lots of pizza in my time on earth, and this one is in my top 3! You place your order at the counter, take a seat, then wait for your number to be called. It is served on a big baking sheet with parchment paper and it is clear that it was JUST removed from a stone pizza oven . There is also a station with \"fixins\" like Parmesan, fresh garlic, pepper flakes, red pepper purée, etc. We got the Margherita with pepperoni.

Cannot wait to go back.<p>\\n', \"This is my favorite pizza place in all of Atlanta, nee, anywhere. I think it's better than pizza I've had in Italy- I can't even explain it. It just tastes better. My favorite is the San Gennaro- subtlety spicy sausage, grape tomatoes, and a perfect ratio of sauce and cheese. And I love getting the extra toppings of parmesan cheese, fresh garlic, and chili oil.<p>\\n\", \"Guys. Antico Pizza is good. Kinda salty. But I like watching the workers make the pizza. They swirl it in the air and put all the ingredients on. The atmosphere is nice...I guess that's what I'm trying to say. Also, this pizza *seems* a lot more authentic. I don't know what that means tbh bc I've never had authentic pizza in Italy but it's definitely not papa johns or blaze. In that regard it's good and it *feels* authentic at least. Hopefully that's enough disclaimer for any pizza ExPeRtS on yelp who might hurt me for saying something wrong. I definitely would try this place if you didn't know where to eat and/or wanted pizza.<p>\\n\", 'Antico is hands down my most favorite place to get a good thin crust pizza.

The crust was soft, but not too soft. You get your own toppings and it's not just the garlic powder or Parmesan cheese. It's actual garlic, there's oil, chili pepper. I mixed all of the toppings together and dipped my pizza in it. Loved it. Also loved the Italian feel to it with the staff and the music. Definitely recommend this place to anyone around the area.<p>\\n\", \"If you don't get pizza here, you are wrong. I have traveled far and wide to find the best pizza in the United States. I lost my girlfriend, sold my car, and even had to give away my dog in order to finance my journey. One day, I was picked up by a rogue trucker and told him of my mission. He, in his diesel-smoke covered steel horse, told me of Antico. I came to this place with nothing but $21.47. They recommended the margarita pizza, and after my first bite, I woke up in a brand new suit with a fresh haircut and a college degree. Antico changed my life, and it will change yours. Eat here.<p>\\n\", 'Hands down the BEST pizza in town!\\nIf authentic is what you\\'re after, you\\'ll appreciate the simplicity and tastiness of the pizza here. A true demonstration of what the concept \"Less is more\" is about!!<p>\\n', \"The pizza here is probably as authentic to Italian as you can get from what I gather. It's a nice large piece of bread with cheese and some ingredients. They only have so many options for your pizza, now among those, every choice will be pretty good, but you cannot customize it for just what you want. I also think it's a bit pricey for a rather plain pizza.\\n\\nThe place is a different setup than usual. It's open family style seating, so you're going to be sharing tables, it was just the two of us, so we opted for outside seating, which is across the road at the Gelato place. A little strange, but okay, the server had to carry our pizza from the other building. The seating area at gelato place was pleasant enough, but being so far away I was not able to another glass of wine.\\n\\nIt was a good experience for a weekend visit, but I would probably choose a cheaper place with easier seating.<p>\\n\", \"My go-to place when it's a matter of pizza. Probably the best pizza in ATL! But watch out, this is not your usual restaurant as you will be seated on high table or shared table.<p>\\n\", \"This is definitely not a place to go if you don't like certain things on your pizza.  None of the pizzas were appealing to me the way they were.  I tried ordering a pizza with no tomatoes (can't stand them) and was told they aren't allowed to modify the pizzas.  WTH?  If I'm paying $20+ for a pizza I expect to be able to modify it ever so slightly.  I was just asking for an item to be removed, not a substitution.  I won't be back.  At least I can get it how I want it at Bambinellis.<p>\\n\", 'Its a OK pizza spot if you like the italian style brick oven. Coming from nyc I still cant find the slice and snapple pizza joint . This spot always you to bring alcohol.<p>\\n', 'Great pizza stop. In ATL for the day and it was quick and phenomenal. The pizza was made fresh, and it was out quick. Fun environment and great service.<p>\\n', \"I've been here twice while in Atlanta, visiting my daughter....what a cool place! There are only a few seats in the front of the store but much more seating in the kitchen area. Long communal tables are available. You can watch the cooks making the yummy pies. All pizzas are one size and the menu has a limited number of pies, but you can always add or delete items to a pie in order to customize.\\nThin crust, with additional help yourself garnishes such as olive oil &amp; basil. Delicious!!!<p>\\n\", 'It was very fresh and delicious pizza. Not much waiting which was good too. Pretty big size and thin crust. They had chilly paper pickle that was so good. Sald was very fresh but bit pricy. After eating pizza we went to have some gelato and coffee it was okay.<p>\\n']\n"
